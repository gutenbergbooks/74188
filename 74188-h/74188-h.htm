THE CALL OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE<br>
UNITED STATES
</p>

<p>“It is a distressing and oppressive duty, Gentlemen of the
Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you.
There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice
ahead of us. It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful
people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all
wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the
right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the
things which we have always carried nearest our hearts....
To such a task we can dedicate our lives and our
fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have,
with the pride of those who know that the day has come when
America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for
the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the
peace which she has treasured. God helping her, she can do
no other.”</p>

THE ANSWER OF THE CONGRESS OF THE<br>
UNITED STATES
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, The Imperial German Government has committed
repeated acts of war against the Government and the
People of the United States of America; therefore be it</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United States of America, in Congress assembled</i>, That
the state of war between the United States and the Imperial
German Government which has thus been thrust upon the
United States is hereby formally declared; and that the
President be, and he is hereby, authorized and directed to
employ the entire naval and military forces of the United
States and the resources of the Government to carry on war
against the Imperial German Government; and to bring the

STATEMENT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE<br>
UNITED STATES<br>
<br>
<i>February 1, 1919</i>
</p>

<p>On the occasion of the dissolution to-day of the American
Protective League and the final termination of all of its activities,
I take the opportunity to express to its National
Directors and all other officers and members my personal
thanks for their assistance to me and to my Department during
the period of the war. I am frank to say that the
Department of Justice could not have accomplished its task
and attained the measure of success which it did attain without
the assistance of the members of the League.</p>

<p>Your reward can only be the expressed thanks of your
Government. As the head of the Department of Justice,
under which the American Protective League operated, I
render you such thanks with sincere pleasure. Upon the
occasion of a request from a member of the Committee on
the Judiciary of the House of Representatives for an expression
of opinion by me as to the adoption of a joint resolution
by the Congress of the United States, extending the thanks
of Congress to the members of the League, I have urged in
strong terms the adoption of such a resolution, as one justly
earned by the organization during an extended period of
devoted and effective service.</p>

<p>The work of your organization will long be an inspiration
to all citizens to render their full measure of service to their
country according to her need, without reward, and with
abundant zeal.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="AUTHORS_PREFACE">AUTHOR’S PREFACE</h2>

<p>“Signed!”</p>

<p>The one word, spoken by a young officer of the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Army,
a strip of paper in his hand, confirmed to his associates the
greatest news the world has ever known. It was the corrected
foreword of peace. The armistice had validly been signed
by Germany.</p>

<p>In these first days of peace, the streets were full of shouting,
laughing, weeping men and women gone primitive. The
sane and sober population of America, engaged in sending
a third of a million men a month to join the two millions
on the front in France, turned into a mob. Their frenzy
was that of joy. The war was over.</p>

<p>On the day following the confirmation of the armistice,
some who had sat together in a certain room in Washington
were scattered. Six thousand resignations of Army officers
were handed in within twenty-four hours. The room in
which the news of the war’s end was thus received was one
in the Military Intelligence Division of the General Staff in
Washington. There lie the secrets of the Army. All in that
room were officers of the Army, or soon to be such. All
were volunteers. I may with propriety say that for a time I
had sat with those who had ear to the secret voices of the
world, in the tensest atmosphere I ever knew.</p>

<p>It was whispers that “M.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;D.” heard—the whispers of
perfidious men, communicating one with the other, plotting
against the peace of America, the dignity of our Government,
the sacredness of our flag, the safety of American
lives and property. Here sat the authorized agents of the
Army, employed to hear such whispers, enlisted to catch the
most skilled and unscrupulous spies the world has ever
known, the agents of a treacherous and dishonorable enemy.</p>

<p>All those connected with the Military Intelligence Division
daily felt also the touch of this great, silent, smooth-running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
machinery of the Department of Justice, whose governmental
mission it was to do detective work on the largest
scale this country ever knew. We heard the voice of the
War College through the official liaison therewith; also those
of the General Staff, the War Department, the Post Office
Department, the cable censors, the censors of the Expeditionary
Forces. It all worked as an interlocking, vast, silent
machine—a solemnly, almost mournfully silent machine, of
which America knows almost nothing, the rest of the world
nothing at all.</p>

<p>Day by day, in ghostly silhouette, passed sinister figures,
themselves silent; those who plotted against America. All
the deeds that can come from base and sordid motives, from
low, degenerate and perverted minds; all the misguided phenomena
of human avarice and hate and eagerness to destroy
and kill—such were the pictures on the walls of “M.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;D.”</p>

<p>I have spoken of certain essential liaisons against espionage
and propaganda. More often seen than any other initials
in the desk algebra of “M.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;D.” were three initials—“A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.”
This or that information came from A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
This was referred to A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. for more light. Every questionnaire
of a man applying for a commission in the Army
was referred back to A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L., and A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. took up the
question of his unswerving and invincible loyalty. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
found slackers and deserters in thousands. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. found
this or that spy, large or little. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L., obviously, had a
busy mind and a long arm.</p>

<p>Yet if you should look in the Governmental Blue Book
for this powerful branch of our Government, you could not
find the initials there at all. Very many Americans never
heard the name of this wholly unofficial organization which
passed on so many governmental questions, was of so much
aid in so many ways to the Government. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. is not and
never was a part of any state or national arm, service, department,
or bureau. But openly and proudly it has always
been definitely authorized to carry on all its letter-heads,
“Organized with the Approval and Operating under the
Direction of the United States Department of Justice, Bureau
of Investigation.” These are its credentials.</p>

<p>A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L., the mysterious power behind our Government,
was no baseless fabric of a vision, as hundreds of Germans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
and pro-Germans can testify through their prison bars; but
it passes now and soon will “leave not a wrack behind.”
As these pages advance, the word issues for its official demobilization.
It was honorably encamped on a secret and
silent battlefield, but now, once more to use a poet’s word,
it has “folded its tents like the Arab, and silently stolen
away.” It was, and is not. You never have known what
it was. You never will see its like again.</p>

<p>“A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.” means the American Protective League. It
means a silent, unknown army of more than a quarter million
of the most loyal and intelligent citizens of America,
who indeed did spring to arms over night. It fought battles,
saved lives, saved cities, saved treasures, defended the flag,
apprehended countless traitors, did its own tremendous share
in the winning of the war. It saved America. It did protect.
It was a league.</p>

<p>It did all this without a cent of pay. It had no actual
identification with the Government. Yet it has won scores
of times the written and spoken thanks of our most responsible
Government officials. Its aid in the winning of the war
can not be estimated and never will be known. Not even
its full romance ever can be written. May these hurrying
pages save all these things at least in part, though done in
the full consciousness that their tribute can be but a fragment
of the total due.</p>

<p>The American Protective League was the largest company
of detectives the world ever saw. The members served
without earlier specialized training, without pay, without
glory. That band of citizens, called together overnight, rose,
grew and gathered strength until able to meet, and absolutely
to defeat, the vast and highly trained army of the
German espionage system, which in every country of the
globe flooded the land with trained spies who had made a
life business of spying. It met that German Army as ours
met it at Chateau-Thierry, and in the Argonne, and on the
Vesle and on the Aisne. Like to our Army under arms—that
Army where any of us would have preferred to serve
had it been possible for us to serve under arms—it never
gave back an inch of ground. Growing stronger and better
equipped each day, it worked always onward and forward
until the last fight was won.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. has folded its unseen and unknown tents. It will
bivouac elsewhere until another day of need may come. Then,
be sure, it will be ready. On the day that the American Protective
League disbanded, it had no money in the treasury.
It had spent millions of dollars, and had brought to judgment
three million cases of disloyalty. There, obviously, unwritten
and unknown, scattered in every city and hamlet of
America, was a tremendous story, one of the greatest of all
war stories, the story of the line behind the guns.</p>

<p>When the men of long or of transient connection with
M.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;D. had shaken hands and said good-bye, the National
Directors of the American Protective League asked me to
stop on and write the history of the American Protective
League. And so, in large part, as a matter of loyalty and
duty, with millions of pages of records at hand, with a quarter
of a million friends I have never seen, who never have
seen one another, who never otherwise would know the identity
of one another, I began to do something which most
obviously and certainly ought to be done. This book is written
alike that these quarter million unpaid soldiers may
know of one another, and that a hundred million Americans
may also know of them accurately, and thank them for what
they did.</p>

<p>Before I had done the last page of the strange history, I
knew that I had felt an actual reflex of the actual America.
I knew that I had been in touch with one of the most astonishing
phenomena of modern days, in touch also with the most
tremendous, the most thrilling and the most absorbing story
of which I ever knew.</p>

Growth of the Greatest Semi-Vigilante Movement

</div>

<p>We Americans have always been disposed to peace. We
have not planned for war. Our Army has never been a
menace to ourselves or to any other nation; our Navy,
though strong and modern, never has been larger than a
country of our extent in territory and industry admittedly
ought to have. No one has feared us, and there has been
none of whom we have had any fear. We have designedly
stood aloof from entangling alliances. The two great
oceans traditionally have been our friends, for they have
set us apart from the world’s quarrels. An America, far
off, new, rich, abounding, a land where a man might be
free to grow to his natural stature, where he might be safe
at his own fireside, where he might select his own rulers
and rest always secure under his own form of government—that
was the theory of this country and of this form of
government. That was the reason why this country, naturally
endowed above any other region of the world, has
grown so marvelously fast.</p>

<p>There was reason for America’s swift stature. She was
a land not of war, but of peace. Rich, she threw open her
doors. Frank, free, honest, generous, she made welcome
all who came. She suspected none, trusted all, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
prove this, offered partnership in her wealth to any man
of the world, under a system of naturalization laws whose
like, in broadness and generosity, does not exist. Peace—and
the chance to grow and to be happy. Peace—and a
partnership in all she had. Peace—and a seat free at the
richest table of the world. That was what America
offered; and in spite of the pinch and the unrest of growing
numbers, in spite of problems imported and not native
to our long-untroubled land, that was the theory of American
life up to a date four years earlier than this.</p>

<p>In that four years America has changed more than in
any forty of her earlier life. But yesterday, young, rich,
laughing, free of care, Homerically mirthful and joyous,
America to-day is mature, unsmiling, grave, dignified—and
wise. What once she never suspected, now she knows.
She has been betrayed.</p>

<p>But America, traditionally resourceful, now suddenly
agonized in the discovery of treachery at her own table,
has out of the very anguish of her indignant horror, out
of the very need of the hour, suddenly and adequately
risen to her emergency. She always has done so. When
the arms of the appointed agents of the law ever have
wearied, she has upheld them. She has done so now, at the
very moment of our country’s greatest need.</p>

<p>The story of how that was done; how the very force of
the situation demanded and received an instant and sufficient
answer; how the civilians rallied to their own flag;
how they came out of private life unasked, unsummoned,
as though at spoken command of some central power—that
is a great and splendid story of which few ever have
known anything at all.</p>

<p>It is a great and splendid story because it verifies
America and her intent before all the high courts of
things. These men did obey the summons of a vast central
power. But it was no more than the soul of America that
spoke. It was no more than her theory of the democracy
of mankind which issued that unwritten order to assemble
the minute men, each armed and garbed in his own way
and each resolved to do what he could in a new and tremendous
day of Lexington.</p>

<p>It was not autocracy which gave the assembly call to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
these silent legions. They mobilized themselves, so rapidly
as to offer one of the most curious psychological problems
of history. Why did these men leave their homes almost
all at once, each unknown at first to the other, in large
part each unknown to the other even now? How did it
come about that an army of a quarter of a million men
enlisted themselves and then offered their services to a
government which needed them but never had asked for
them? How did it come that—contrary to all European
traditions—this tremendous striking-power began at the
bottom in our democratic war-born instinct, and worked
upward into the Government itself, as a new institution,
wholly unrecognized in the constitution of state or nation?
Usually the Government issues the order for mobilization.
But here the greatest band of minute men ever known in
the world mobilized as though unconsciously, as though
to some spiritual trumpet call. Having done so, it offered
itself to the Nation’s heads, saying, “Here we are. Take
us and use us. We ask no pay. <i>We enlist till the end of
the war.</i>”</p>

<p>It was the spirit voice of anguished America which mobilized
the American Protective League. There never was
a time when America could lose this war. The answer was
always written in the stars. Somewhere, high up in the
heavens, blind Justice let fall her sword in a gesture of
command; and that was all. The issue of the war was
determined from that moment. It was certain that Germany,
brutal, bloody, autocratic, destructive, would be defeated
beyond the sea. Yes, and on this side of the sea.</p>

<p>On this side, much was to be done, more than we had
dreamed. Troubled but unparticipating, we stood aloof
and watched the soil of all Europe redden with the blood
of men—and of women and children. Even we still stood
aloof, hands clenched, gasping in an enraged incredulity,
watching the sea also—the free and open highway of the
world, redden with the blood of men—and of women and
children. But still we took no part, though indeed some
of our young men could no longer stay at home and so
enlisted under some Allied flag.</p>

<p>We held in mind our ancient remoteness from all this.
We heard still the counsel against entangling alliances.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
And, quite aside from the idea of material profit, we tried
to be fair and impartial in a fight that was not yet ours,
though every American heart bled with France and Belgium,
ached in pain with that of Britain, locked in death
grapple in her greatest war—that which must name her
still free or forever enslaved. And from Washington came
admonition to be calm. President Wilson’s appeal went
out again and again to the people, and whether or not it
ever once seemed to all of us a possible thing for the
United States to keep out of this war, at least we sought
to do so and were advised and commanded to do so by the
chief of our own forces.</p>

<p>Whether or not we all wished to be neutral so many
years, we officially and nationally were neutral. Therefore
we retained our commercial rights under neutrality.
Doing no more than Germany always previously had done,
we made and sold arms and munitions in the open markets
of the world.</p>

<p>But Germany could not come and get her arms and munitions
had she wished to do so. Great Britain had something
to say about that. Wherefore Germany hated us,
secretly and openly—hated us for doing what she once had
done but could no longer do.</p>

<p>The enforcement of blockade made Germany hate us.
Germany’s psychology has always been double-faced—one
face for herself and one for the rest of the world. The
Austrian double-headed eagle belongs of right also on the
German coat of arms. “What I do not wish to have done
to me is Wrong; what I wish to do to others is Right!”
That is the sum and substance of the German public creed
and the German private character—and now we fairly
may say we know them both. The German is not a sportsman—he
does not know the meaning of that word. He
has not in his language any word meaning “fair play.”
Nothing is fair play to a German which does not work to
his advantage. The American neutrality in combination
with the British blockade did not work to his advantage.
Hence—so he thought—it was all wrong.</p>

<p>The Germans began to hate America more and more.
We did not know, at that time, that Germany had been
planning many years for “diesen aufunsangehängten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
Krieg”—“this war forced on us!” We did not have any
idea that she had counted upon two million German-Americans
to help her win this war; that she knew every nook
and cranny of the United States and had them mapped;
that for years she had maintained a tremendous organization
of spies who had learned every vulnerable point of
the American defenses, who were better acquainted with
our Army than we ourselves were, and who had extended
their covert activities to a degree which left them arrogantly
confident of their success at war, and contemptuous
of the best that America ever could do against her. Germany
never doubted that she would win this war. It was
charted and plotted out many years in advance, move by
move, step by step, clear through to the bloody and brutal
end which should leave Germany commander of the world.</p>

<p>Now, in the German general plan of conquest, America
had had her place assigned to her. So long as she would
remain passive and complaisant—so long as she would
furnish munitions to Germany and not to England or
France or Russia, all well, all very good. But when, by
any shift of the play, America might furnish supplies to
Germany’s enemies and not to Germany—no matter
through whose fault—then so much the worse for America!
It never was intended that America should be anything
but expansion ground for Germany, whether or not she
remained complaisant. But if she did not—if she began
in her own idea of neutrality to transgress Germany’s two-headed
idea of “neutrality”—that meant immediate and
positive action against America, now, to-day, and not after
a while and at Germany’s greater leisure.</p>

<p>“I shall have no foolishness from America!” said William
Hohenzollern to the accredited representative of this
country in his court—William Hohenzollern, that same
pitiable figure who at the final test of defeat had not the
courage of Saul to fall on his sword, not the courage of
a real King to die at the head of his army, but who fled
from his army like a coward when he saw all was lost—even
honor. His threat of a million Germans in America
who would rise against us was not ill-based. They were
here. They are here now, to-day. The reply to that threat,
made by Gerard, is historic. “Majesty, let them rise. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
have a million lamp-posts waiting for them.” And this
herein tells the story of how the million traitors at
America’s too generous table were shown the lamp-posts
looming.</p>

<p>The German anger at America grew to the fury point,
and she began covertly to stir herself on this side of the sea.
The rustling of the leaves began to be audible, the hissing
grew unmistakable. But America, resting on her old
traditions, paid no attention. We heard with sympathy
for a time the classic two-faced German-American’s wail,
“Germany is my mother, America my wife! How can I
fight my mother?” The truth is that all too many German-Americans
never cared for America at all in any tender
or reverent way. Resting under their Kaiser’s Delbrueck
injunction never to forget the fatherland, they never were
anything but German. They used America; they never
loved her. They clung to their old language, their old
customs, and cared nothing for ours. They prospered,
because they would live as we would not live. It would
be wrong to call them all bad, and folly to call them all
good. As a class they were clannish beyond all other
races coming here. Many who at first were openly pro-German
became more discreet; but of countless numbers
of these, it is well known that at their own firesides and
in supposed secrecy they privately were German, although
in public they were American. Of Liberty bond buyers,
many of the loudest boasters were of this “loyal German-American
citizenship.” They really had not earned even
the hyphen.</p>

<p>Open and covert action was taken by Germany on both
sides of the Atlantic to bring America into line. Not fearing
America, nor knowing the real America at all, Germany
did much as she liked. Outrages on the high seas
began. All international law was cast aside by Germany
as fully as in her invasion of Belgium. She counted so
surely on success and world-conquest that she was absolutely
arrogant and indifferent alike to law and to humanity.
The militaristic Germany began to show—brutal,
crafty, bestial, lacking in all honor, ignorant of the word
“fair play,” callous to every appeal of humanity, wholly
and unscrupulously selfish. We began now to see the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
significance of that “efficiency” of which our industrial
captains sometimes had prated over-much. Yes, Germany
was efficient!</p>

<p>The strain between the two countries increased as the
blockade tightened, and as the counter-plot of the German
submarines developed. Then came the Lusitania....
I can not write of that. I have hated Germany since then,
and thousands of loyal Americans join in hatred for her.
All of good America has been at war with her at heart
from that very day, because in America we never have
made war on women and children. We are bound by
every instinct to hate any nation that does, Turk, German
or ignorant savage.</p>

<p>The Lusitania was Germany’s deliberate action. She
arrogantly commanded us in a few newspaper advertisements
not to sail on the Lusitania—as though she owned
us and the sea. After the deed, she struck medals in commemoration
of it. German church bells rang to glorify it.
A German holiday was created to celebrate it. German
preachers there and in America preached sermons lauding
it. It was a national act, nationally planned, nationally
ratified. From that day we were at war. Let those who
like, of whatever station, say “We are not at war with
the German people.” That is not true. The German
people, the German rank and file, not their leaders alone,
were back of all these deeds and ratified them absolutely
on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>From that day, too, the issue might really have been
known. I went into the elevator of a building in my city,
a copy of a newspaper in my hand with the black headline
of the Lusitania across the page. The German operator of
the elevator saw it as I turned it toward him silently.
“Vell, they vere varned!” he said, and grinned.</p>

<p>That incident shows Germany in America, then and now,
covert, sinister, sneering, confident, exultant. You could
not find an answer you would dare speak to such a man.
There is no deed that you could do. I pulled together, and
only said, “It will cost Germany the war.” And so it did.</p>

<p>But we did not go to war; we tried to keep out of the
war. The daily page of red horrors fresh from Europe
taught us what war meant at this day of the world.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
Women naturally did not like the thought of casting their
sons into that brutal hell. And then arose the female-men,
the pacifists, forgetting their sex, forgetting their country,
forgetting the large and lasting game of humanity’s good,
which cannot count present cost, but must plan for the
long game of the centuries.</p>

<p>With the pacifists suddenly and silently rose the hidden
army of German espionage and German sympathy in our
own country, quick to see that here was their chance!
Millions of German gold now came pouring across to
finance this break in America’s forces. Her high ministers
to our Government began their treachery, forgetful of all
ambassadorial honor, perjuring themselves and their country.
The war was on, on both sides the Atlantic now.</p>

<p>And still America did not know, and still America did
not go to war. We dreaded it, held back from it, month
after month—some, as it seems to many, wrongly and
unhappily even did what they could to capitalize the fact
that we were not at war. But the hidden serpent raised
its head and began to strike—to strike so openly, in so
long a series of overt acts, that now our civil courts and
the great national machinery of justice in Washington
became literally helpless in their endeavors at resistance.</p>

<p>We were not at war, but war was waged against us in
so many ways—against our lives and property—that all
sense of security was gone. We offered as our defense
not, as yet, our Fleet or our Army, but our Department
of Justice. Day and night that department at Washington,
and its branches in all the great cities, in New York,
Chicago, Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco,
labored to clear the constantly increasing dockets, to keep
down the constantly increasing heaps of suspect cases. It
was evident that America was hearing from the Kaiser’s
million Germans in America. But where were the lamp
posts?</p>

<p>The Department of Justice found itself flooded and submerged
with work in the Bureau of Investigation, collecting
evidence against German spies and German lawbreakers.
It was plain what efforts now were making to
undermine America. But the truth was, the grist was too
much for the mill. We had never organized a system to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
handle covert and hidden war as Germany had done. We
had fought in the open when, rarely, we had fought at all.
The great mill of Justice clogged up and broke down, not
from any inefficiency or inadequacy in average times, but
because it never could have been predicted that “Neutrality
Cases” such as these ever would be known in our
history. In this war, giant figures only have ruled. The
world was not prepared for them.</p>

<p>The outrages went on. Germany, confident of the success
of ruthless submarine warfare, told us when we could
sail, how we must mark our ships—said, sneeringly, “Vell,
you vas varned!”</p>

<p>It had very early become plain to all Americans that we
could not always submit to this. More and more now we
were browbeaten and insulted. More and more also our
hearts were wrung at the sight of splendid France, fighting
gamely and proudly and silently for her life; at the lists
of the gallant British dead; the whole story of the staggering
lines of Liberty. It was plain that the great prize
of free institutions, of human liberty itself, was about to
be lost to the world forever. It became plain that the
glorious traditions of America must perish, that her answer
to humanity must be forever stilled, that she, too, must be
included in the ruin of all the good things of the world.
It began also to be said more and more openly that
America would come next—that we must fight; if not now,
then at some later day, and perhaps without these Allies.</p>

<p>So our war spirit began in the total to outweigh and
overtop our peace spirit and our pacifist spirit and our
hesitant spirit. We knew we would be at war. Many of
us deplored and do still deplore the fact that we waited
so long in times so perilous. We lost two precious years;
billions in treasure, and what is immeasurably worse, millions
in lives. So much for hesitancy.</p>

<p>But now, as bearing upon the purpose of this account
of the American Protective League, it is to be kept in
mind that for months and years the Department of Justice
had been at war with the hidden German army here. And,
as the Germans were pushing back the Allies over there,
they were pushing us back here, because we were not ready
for so unforeseen a situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>What saves a country in its need? Its loyal men. What
reinforces an army called on for sudden enlargement? Its
volunteers. What saved San Francisco in its days of riot
and anarchy in 1850? Its Volunteers for law and order.
What brought peace to Alder Gulch in 1863 when criminals
ruled? Its Volunteers for law and order. America always
has had Volunteers to fight for law and order against
criminals. The law itself says you may arrest without
warrant a man caught committing a felony. The line between
formal written law and natural law is but thin
at best.</p>

<p>There was, therefore, in the spring of 1917 in America,
the greatest menace to our country we ever had known.
Organized criminals were in a thousand ways attacking
our institutions, jeopardizing the safety, the very continuity
of our country. No loyal American was safe. We
did not know who were the disloyal Americans. We faced
an army of masked men. They outnumbered us. We had
no machinery of defense adequate to fight them, because
we foolishly had thought that all these whom we had welcomed
and fed were honest in their protestations—<i>and
their oaths</i>—when they came to us.</p>

<p>So now, we say, an imperious cry of NEED came, wrung
from astounded and anguished America. It was as though
this actual cry came from the heavens, “I need you, my
children! Help me, my children!”</p>

<p>That cry was heard. How, it is of small importance to
any member of the American Protective League, whose
wireless antennæ, for the time attuned, caught down that
silent wireless from the skies. No one man sent that message.
Almost, we might say, no one man answered it, so
many flocked in after the first word of answer. No one
man of the two hundred and fifty thousand who first and
last answered in one way or another would say or would
want to say that he alone made so large an answer to so
large a call. None the less, we deal here with actual history.
So that now we may begin with details, begin to
show how those first strands were woven which in a few
weeks or months had grown into one of America’s strongest
cables of anchorage against the terror which was
abroad upon the sea.</p>

<p>Methods of Work—Getting the Evidence—The Organization
in Detail—The Multifold Activities of the League.</p>
</div>

<p>It is to Mr. A. M. Briggs of Chicago that credit should
go for the initial idea of the American Protective League.
The first flash came many months before the declaration
of war, although, for reasons outlined, it long was obvious
that we must eventually go to war.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice in Chicago was in a terribly
congested condition, and long had been, for the neutrality
cases were piling up.</p>

<p>“I could get ten times as much done if I had men and
money to work with,” said Hinton G. Clabaugh, Superintendent
of the Bureau of Investigation. “There are thousands
of men who are enemies of this country and ought
to be behind bars, but it takes a spy to catch a spy, and
I’ve got a dozen spies to catch a hundred thousand spies
right here in Chicago. They have motor cars against my
street cars. They’re supplied with all the money they
want; my own funds are limited. We’re not at war. All
this is civil work. We simply haven’t ways and means
to meet this emergency.”</p>

<p>“I can get ten or twenty good, quiet men with cars
who’ll work for nothing,” said Mr. Briggs one day.
“They’ll take either their business time or their leisure
time, or both, and join forces with you. I know we’re not
at war, but we’re all Americans together.”</p>

<p>In that chance conversation—only we ought not to call
it chance at all, but a thing foreordained—began the greatest
society the world ever saw,—an army of men equipped
with money, brains, loyalty, which grew into one of the
main legions of our defense. That army to-day probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
knows more about you and your affairs than you ever
thought anyone could know. If you were not and are not
loyal, those facts are known and recorded, whether you
live in New York or California or anywhere between.</p>

<p>Once started, the voluntary service idea ran like wildfire.
It began as a free taxicab company, working for the
most impeccable and most dignified branch of our Government—that
branch for which our people always have had
the most respect.</p>

<p>The ten private cars grew to two dozen. As many quiet-faced,
silent drivers as were necessary were always ready.
Word passed among reliable business men, and they came
quietly and asked what they could do. They were the
best men of the city. They worked for principle, not for
excitement, not in any vanity, not for any pay. It was
the “live-wires” of the business world that were selected.
They were all good men, big men, brave and able, else
they must have failed, and else this organization never
could have grown. It was secret, absolutely so; clandestine
absolutely, this organization of Regulators. But unlike the
Vigilantes, the Klu Klux, the Horse-Thief Detectors, it took
no punishments into its own hands. It was absolutely nonpartisan.
It had then and has now no concern with labor
questions or political questions. It worked only as collector
of evidence. It had no governmental or legal status
at all. It tried no cases, suggested no remedies. It simply
<i>found the facts</i>.</p>

<p>It became apparent that the City of Chicago was not all
America. These American men had America and not Chicago
at heart. Before long, five hundred men, in widely
separated and sometimes overlapping sections, were at
work piling up evidence against German and pro-German
suspects. These men began to enlist under them yet others.
The thing was going swiftly, unaccountably swiftly.
America’s volunteers were pouring out. The Minute Men
were afoot again, ready to fight.</p>

<p>This was in March of 1917. Even yet we were not at
war, though in the two years following the Lusitania murders,
the world had had more and more proof of Germany’s
heartless and dishonorable intentions. The snake was now
out of the leaves. The issue was joined. We all knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
that Washington soon would, soon must, declare war. The
country was uneasy, discontented, mutinous over the delay.</p>

<p>Meantime, all these new foci of this amateur organization
began to show problems of organization and administration.
The several captains unavoidably lapped over
one another in their work, and a certain loss in speed and
efficiency rose out of this. The idea had proved good,
but it was so good it was running away with itself! No
set of men could handle it except under a well-matured
and adequately-managed organization, worked out in detail
from top to bottom.</p>

<p>We may not place one man in this League above another,
for all were equal in their unselfish loyalty, from private
to general, from operative to inspector, and from inspector
to National Directors; but it is necessary to set down the
basic facts of the inception of the League in order that
the vast volume and usefulness of its labors properly may
be understood. So it is in order now to describe how this
great army of workers became a unit of immense, united
and effective striking power, how the swift and divers
developments of the original idea became coordinated into
a smooth-running machine, nation-wide in its activities.</p>

<p>Now at last, long deferred—too long—came April 6, 1917.
The black headlines smote silence at every American table.</p>

<p>WAR!</p>

<p>We were at War! Men did not talk much. Mothers
looked at their sons, wives at their husbands. Thousands
of souls had their Gethsemane that day. Now we were to
place our own breasts against the steel of Germany.</p>

<p>The cover was off. War—war to the end, now—war on
both sides of the sea—war against every form and phase
of German activity! America said aloud and firmly now,
as, in her anguish, she had but recently whispered, “I
need you, my children!” And millions of Americans, many
of them debarred from arms by age or infirmity, came
forward, each in his own way, and swore the oath.</p>

<p>The oath of the League spread. Not one city or state,
but all America must be covered, and it must be done at
once. The need of a national administration became at
once imperative.</p>

<p>In this work on the neutrality cases Mr. Clabaugh and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
his volunteer aids often were in Washington together.
The Department of Justice, so far from finding this
unasked civilian aid officious, gladly hailed it as a practical
aid of immeasurable value. It became apparent that the
League was bound to be national in every way at no late
day.</p>

<p>All this meant money. But America, unasked, opened
her secret purse strings. Banks, prominent firms, loyal
individuals gave thousands and hundreds of thousands of
dollars for a work which they knew must be done if
America was to be safe for decent men. And so the silent
army of which you never knew, grew and marched out
daily. Your house, your neighbor’s, was known and
watched, guarded as loyal, circled as disloyal. The nature
of your business and your neighbor’s was known—and
tabulated. You do not know to-day how thoroughly
America knows you. If you are hyphenated now, if you
are disloyal to this flag, so much the worse for you.</p>

<p>It early became plain to manufacturers and owners of
large industrial plants of all sorts that they were in immediate
danger of dynamite outrages. Many plants agreed
to present to the League monthly a considerable checque
to aid the work of safeguarding. Many wealthy individuals
gave additional amounts. A very considerable sum
was raised from the sale of badges to the operatives, it
being explained to all that they were sold at a profit for
the benefit of the League. At all times large amounts
came in, raised by State or local chiefs, each of whom
knew his own community well. On one day in October,
1917, a call went out to 6700 members of the League to
meet on a certain evening at Medinah Temple in Chicago,
admission to be by credentials only. That meeting was
addressed by Chiefs and others. In a short time $82,000
was raised. Later on, certain bankers of national reputation—F.
A. Vanderlip of New York, George M. Reynolds
of Chicago, Festus Wade of St. Louis, Stoddard Jess of
Los Angeles, and others—sent out an appeal to the bankers
of America in the interests of the League. This perhaps
would of itself have raised a half million more, but it
came among Liberty Loan activities, and before it was
fully under way, the news of the Armistice broke, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
automatically ended many things. But the American Protective
League had money. It can have all the money it
may need in any future day.</p>

<p>It was not until fall of 1917 that, in answer to the
imperious demands of the swiftly grown association, now
numbering thousands in every State of the Union, and in
order to get into closer touch with the Department of
Justice, the League moved its headquarters from Chicago
to Washington. Mr. Charles Daniel Frey of Chicago, who
had worked out with his associates the details of a perfectly
subdivided organization, was made Captain U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A.
and liaison officer for the League’s work with the Military
Intelligence Division of the Army, a division which itself
had known great changes and rapid development. The
three National Directors were now A. M. Briggs, Chairman;
Captain Charles Daniel Frey, and Mr. Victor Elting,
the latter gentleman, an attorney of Chicago, having before
now proved himself of the utmost service in handling
certain very tangled skeins. Mr. Elting had been Assistant
Chief in Chicago, working with Mr. Frey as Chief.
Then later came on, from his League duties in Chicago,
Mr. S. S. Doty, a man successful in his own business
organization and of proved worth in working out details
of organization. Many others from Chicago, in many
capacities, joined the personnel in Washington, and good
men were taken on as needed and found. It would be
cheap to attempt mention of these, but it would be wrong
not to give some general mention of the men who actually
had in hand the formation of the League and the conduct
of its widely reaching affairs from that time until its close
at the end of the war. They worked in secrecy and they
asked no publicity then or now.</p>

<p>One thing must be very plain and clear. These men,
each and all of them, worked as civilian patriots, and,
except in a very few necessary clerical cases, without pay
of any sort. There was no mummery about the League,
no countersigns or grips or passwords, no rituals, no rules.
It never was a “secret society,” as we understand that
usually. It was—the American Protective League, deadly
simple, deadly silent, deadly in earnest. There has been
no glory, no pay, no publicity, no advertising, no reward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
in the American Protective League, except as each man’s
conscience gave him his best reward, the feeling that he
had fulfilled the imperative obligations of his citizenship
and had done his bit in the world’s greatest war.</p>

<p>By the time the League was in Washington, it had a
quarter-million members. Its records ran into tons and
tons; its clerical work was an enormous thing.</p>

<p>The system, swiftly carried out, was unbelievably successful.
An unbelievable artesian fountain of American
loyalty had been struck. What and how much work that
body of silent men did, how varied and how imperatively
essential was the work they did, how thrillingly interesting
it became at times as the netted web caught more and
more in its secret sweeping, must be taken up in later
chapters.</p>

<p>As to the total volume of the League’s work, it never
will be known, and no figures will ever cover it more than
partially. It handled in less than two years, for the War
Department alone, over three million cases. It spent millions
of dollars. It had a quarter million silent and resolute
men on its rolls. These men were the best of their communities.
They did not work for pay. They worked
for duty, and worked harder than a like number in any
army of the world. Some of the things they did, some of
the astonishing matters they uncovered, some of the
strange stories they unearthed, will be taken up in order
in the pages following, and in a way more specifically
informing than has hitherto been attempted.</p>

<p>The League totals are tremendous, but the trouble with
totals is that they do not enter into comprehension. A
million dollars means little as a phrase, if left barren of
some yard-stick for comparative measurement. Thus,
when we say that long ago the number of suspect cases
investigated by the American Protective League had passed
the three-million mark, we hail the figures as grandiose,
but have no personal idea of what they mean, no accurate
conception of the multitude, the nature and the multiplicity
in detail of the three million separate and distinct
cases. It is when we begin to go into details as to the
work and its organization from unit to block, from operative
to chief, that we begin to open our eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>The government of this country had had thrown on it
all at once a burden a thousand times as great as that of
times of peace. We had to raise men and money, munitions,
food, fuel for ourselves and all the world. We were
not prepared. We had to learn all at once the one and
hardest thing—one which America never yet had learned—economy.
We had to do all the active and positive material
things necessary to put an Army in the field across
seas—build ships, fabricate ordnance, arm large bodies of
men, train them, feed them, get their fighting morale on
edge.</p>

<p>Yes, all these things—but this was only part. Our negative
defense, our silent forces also had to be developed.
We had to learn economy—and suspicion. That last was
hard to learn. Just as delay and breakdowns happened
in other branches of the suddenly overloaded government,
so a breakdown in the resources of the Department of Justice—least
known but most valuable portion of our nation’s
governmental system—was a thing imminent. That was
because of the swift multiplication of the list of entirely
new things that had to be looked into with justice, and
yet with speed. It is not too much to say that without
the inspired idea of the American Protective League, its
Web spread out behind the lines, there could not long have
been said in the full confidence of to-day, “God reigns,
and the Government at Washington still lives.”</p>

<p>Besides being an auxiliary of the Department of Justice,
the League was the active ally also of the Department of
War, of the Navy, of the State, of the Treasury. It worked
for the Shipping Board, the Fuel and Food Administrations,
and the Alien Property Custodian. It ran down, in
its less romantic labors, sugar-allowance violators, violators
of the gasless-Sunday laws, the lightless-day laws, violators
of the liquor laws, as well as the large offenders—the spies
who got internment or the penitentiary as the penalty of
getting caught. All these large and small activities may
be understood by a glance at the report-sheet of any division
chief. The heads and sub-heads will show the differentiation.
The chart following this chapter will show the
method of organizing the League’s personnel which was used
in practically all the great cities. The table of dates which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
immediately follows, sets forth in outline the League’s early
history, and indicates the rapidly broadening character of
the League’s work.</p>

<p class="p2">This will close a brief and necessarily incomplete review
of the widely ramified nature of that Web which America
made over night in her time of need.</p>

<p>There was also a confidential pamphlet, originally sent

EARLY DAYS OF THE LEAGUE</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“D.&nbsp;J.” and “A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.”—The Personal Statement of the
Chicago Division Superintendent of the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Bureau of
Investigation—Early Days of the League—The Nation
Unprepared—Swift Rallying of the Minute Men.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Without exaggeration, I think the Chicago Division of
the American Protective League did seventy-five per cent
of the Government investigating work of the Chicago district
throughout the period of the war. It seems to me that
this one sentence covers the situation.</i>”—Hinton G. Clabaugh,
Chicago Agent, <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Department of Justice.</p>
</div>

<p>In previous pages a general outline of the birth and
growth of the American Protective League has been given,
with a general statement also as to its wide usefulness
in the exigencies of the tremendous days of the world
war. There will be, however, many thousands of the members
of the League, and a like number of the lay public,
who will be curious as to the specific and more personal
facts surrounding the early days of the organization. Such
facts are part of the country’s history as well as that of
the League, and therefore ought to be recorded, and
recorded accurately and indisputably.</p>

<p>Mr. Hinton G. Clabaugh, division superintendent of the
Bureau of Investigation of the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Department of Justice,
was asked for a written brief, historically covering the
joint activities of the Department of Justice and its A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
auxiliary in Chicago during the early period of the war.
The admirably comprehensive record which Mr. Clabaugh
has furnished appears in this volume as <a href="#APPENDIX_A">Appendix A</a>.</p>

<p>No statement of facts and figures, however, or of dates
and details, can really cover the story of the American
Protective League. It has a character and a history which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
refuse to classify or to run parallel with other organizations.
It was an idea born out of a vast necessity, and
its growth seemed to be a thing apart from ordinary business
methods. Indeed, it sprang into such rapid stature
that in large part its officers followed it rather than led it.
It was almost sporadic in a thousand towns, so quickly
did the achievement of organization follow the realization
of the need. Thereafter came the days of national organization,
of system, patience, perseverance, and efficiency,
which made it a well-knit power in all parts of the
country.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Clabaugh’s privilege to have lent aid and encouragement
in the days when the League was not yet a
reality, the early days when all was nebulous, when no
one knew anyone else, and when cases were pouring into
D.&nbsp;J. that had to be handled in the best way possible and
at the first moment possible.</p>

<p>The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. has always served the regular organization
of the law, has always worked with or under the supervision
of the D.&nbsp;J. bureau chief nearest at hand, and,
indeed, never pretended to do more than that. But this
coöperation and interlocking of forces was an easier thing
for D.&nbsp;J. superintendents elsewhere, later in the game, after
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. had become an accepted success all over the
country.</p>

<p>It was at the very beginning that the greatest difficulties
had to be met, and it was during these early troubled days
of the League that its history became inseparably linked
with that of the Chicago bureau of the Department of Justice.
Set down in a seething center of alien activity—for
so we may justly call Chicago in the early days of this
war—with only a handful of men to rely on, with no laws,
no precedents, no support, no help, no past like to the present,
and no future that could be predicated on anything
that had gone before, Mr. Clabaugh’s bureau was the first
to get swamped with the neutrality cases—and the first
to be offered counsel, friendship, support, help, money, men
and methods, all in quality and amount fitted to win the
day for him at once. The Clabaugh story, therefore, is the
most important one told by any bureau chief, and it is
historically indispensable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>It is all very well to have confidence in our government
and to believe in a general way that it cannot err and
cannot fail, but government in peace and government in
war times are two distinct and separate propositions. The
sheer truth is that there was absolutely no arm or branch
of our government which was prepared for war. In part,
we never did get prepared for it, so far as essential equipment
of a military sort is concerned. In artillery, in aeroplanes,
in various sorts of munitions and of equipment, we
were not ready for war when the Armistice was signed.
We had no adequate military or intelligence system, and
the splendid force built up as M.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;D. was built after the
war was begun and not before. In the same way—although,
of course, we had the American faith and respect
for our courts, believing them to be in some way supernal
institutions which could not err and which needed no attention
on the part of the people—our judiciary also was
unprepared for war. It never would have been prepared
for war—never in the world—had it not been for the
American Protective League. It is certainly a most
curious, almost an uncanny story, how the Minute Men of
America once more saved the day, responding instantly to
a great national need, not knowing overmuch of this new
game, but each resolved to fight—each, if you please, resolving
in unheroic and undramatic way—in much the
same frame of mind of those men at Verdun who wrote
on the page of martial history the clarion phrase, “They
shall not pass!”</p>

<p>The enemy did not pass in Chicago, nor in New York,
nor in San Francisco, nor in any place between. Not
prepared—a whole nation in shirtsleeves at the plow—we
became prepared. We fought with one hand, while, with
the other, we buttoned on the new tunic for which we had
not yet been measured, and in Army, Navy, Aviation, Intelligence,
Supply, Motor Transport and Department of
Justice, we learned as we fought—and won. The organization
of the American Protective League reveals a curious
phase of life in this republic. It could not have taken
place in any other country of the world.</p>

<p>“A word as to the Chicago organization is in order,”
says the writer of this first report of D.&nbsp;J. on A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
“The work of the League was presumed to be to report
matters of a disloyal nature that came to the attention
of the members and to see that they were brought to the
attention of the proper Government officials. However,
the work of the agents of the Bureau itself increased so
rapidly at this time that it was a physical impossibility
for the small number to handle the same, and by degrees
members of the League who showed aptitude for the work
were called upon to assist the agents of the Bureau. <i>Gradually,
more and more work was thrown on the League until
practically all complaints coming to the Bureau by mail were
turned over to the League for them to investigate.</i>”</p>

<p>If, during the later months of the war, you had visited
the Department of Justice in the Federal Building in Chicago,
you would have found extensive and well-equipped
offices, ably manned and humming with activity. Yet the
Chicago department, though large in personnel and efficient
in administration, was greatly overworked in this
hotbed of pro-German and enemy spy activity.</p>

<p>After leaving the Federal Building, let us say, you had
also decided to visit the headquarters of the volunteer
organization in Chicago. Less than a block away from the
federal offices, in a stately building given over entirely to
the housing of organizations whose sole aim and purpose
was the winning of the war, you would have found a set
of offices as large, as well equipped, as full of filed records,
and of as able a personnel as those of the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> bureau.
There would be this difference: the latter offices—those
of the American Protective League—were run by men who
got no pay—and there were almost one hundred times as
many of them as there were of the D.&nbsp;J. workers. Yet
the two great organizations are parts of the same system,
and have worked together in perfect harmony and mutual
benefit. Together, they have held German crime and
espionage helpless in Chicago all through the war.</p>

<p>Of course, the tremendously expensive operations of so
large a secret service organization could be met only by
large-handed voluntary giving on the part of private citizens.
For instance, the office rent alone of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
in Chicago ran into thousands of dollars monthly. It was
all carried by one public utility concern, the Commonwealth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
Edison Company, which turned over the
needed space in a building which formerly housed its own
offices. It is a part of the private history of the Department
of Justice, scarcely if ever mentioned, that long before
the idea of the American Protective League was
broached—indeed, at the time when we had just severed
diplomatic relations with Germany—Mr. Samuel Insull,
afterward Chairman of the State Council of Defense for
Illinois, called on Mr. Clabaugh and offered financial aid
to the Bureau of Investigation. He said: “I know how
meager your resources are, and I believe there is a lot of
trouble not far ahead. Let me know if you need men or
money, and I’ll see that you get both.” This, of course,
had nothing to do with the later organization of the
League, nor with the idea on which it is based, but Mr.
Clabaugh always has said that Mr. Insull was the first
private citizen to his knowledge to offer financial aid to the
<span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Government.</p>

<p>The public has heard more of “D.&nbsp;J.” than it has of
“A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.” for obvious reasons. Of the two great office
systems, one has been running for many years as a
known part of the Federal Government. The other was
two years old, and was always secret in its work and
personnel. If it ever were a question of credit or “glory,”
the palm must go and has gone to the Federal arm, because
that is where the dénouements of cases had their home,
and where publication of the printable facts originated.
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. carried the evidence to the door of D.&nbsp;J. and
stopped. It started cases, but did not finish them.</p>

<p>The public never had more than a very vague idea of
the workings of the vast duo-fold machine which held life
and property in America so safe in the dangerous days of
the war. For instance, the average man reading newspaper
mention of Mr. Clabaugh’s activities as bureau head,
usually thought of him as public prosecutor. He was not
that. It was his duty, as it was the League’s duty, only to
procure testimony. His work was not of the legal branch,
and he himself never has been admitted to the bar, although
he—with his auxiliary, A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.—has won the
largest and most stubbornly fought criminal cases in the
history of the country, and is devoutly feared to-day by
countless I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.’s not yet arrested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>The story of all these curiously interactive agencies,
official and amateur, is indeed the greatest detective story
in the world, and it is very difficult to measure it in full,
or to visualize it in detail, so simply did it all happen, so
naturally, so swiftly and so much as a matter of course.
There is no like proof in history of the ability of the
American people to govern itself and to take care of itself.
Mr. Clabaugh’s vivid and accurate story will bear out all
these statements, and it is requested that it be read by
all who wish a clear and consecutive acquaintance with the
history of the American Protective League. Attention is
again called to it as printed in full in <a href="#APPENDIX_A">Appendix A</a>.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>
THE LEAGUE IN WASHINGTON</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Summary of the League’s Results Throughout the United
States—Report of the National Directors—Facts, Figures
and Totals for All the Divisions.</p>
</div>

<p>Facts now may be made public property which until
lately might not have been divulged. We therefore shall
find profit now in studying the central organization by
means of which the aroused Americans combined to fight
the hidden forces of their unscrupulous enemy. The origin
and growth, the general plans and methods of the American
Protective League, have been explained; and it will
now be well, before we pass on to the specific story of the
League’s activities, to give some idea of the wide-reaching
consolidation of those activities which followed upon the
establishment of the National Headquarters.</p>

<p>The report of any official may seem dry and formal, but
the records should be made to show how America’s amateur
Scotland Yard organized to fight the forces of Germany
all over America. This portion of the League’s
story is therefore of great value to anyone desirous of
knowing the logical steps by which the League developed
into a truly national institution.</p>

<p>The liaison officer of the National Directors, Captain
Charles Daniel Frey, made his report and summary of
November, 1918, to Colonel K. C. Masteller of the General
Staff, Chief of the negative branch of the Military Intelligence
Division. This report was a general assembling
of the national activities of the League up to the time of
the signing of the Armistice. Certain extracts are made
in consonance with the general outline above indicated.
It should be noted that this report covers only a portion
of the League’s work in Washington. The Department of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
Justice figures, as was to be expected, exceeded those of
any other branch of the League’s work. The War Department
totals were also very high—evidence of service
rendered by the League which the War Department always
has been very courteous and grateful in acknowledging.
Captain Frey’s report reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: In compliance with your request, we beg to submit the
following statement of service rendered the War Department
by the American Protective League. As you know, local
divisions of the League are in operation in practically all
towns and cities of substantial size throughout the United
States, and the League has been extended, through a plan of
county organization, generally throughout the rural communities.
It is not possible to submit to you an accurate classified
statement of the aggregate of all of the work done throughout
the country. We are able, however, to present a general
statement of the activities of the League for the War Department
of the United States, with a detailed report of the work
of the local divisions in one hundred communities of the country.
The total population of these communities is approximately
one-seventh of the population of the entire country.</p>

<p>The work of the American Protective League for the Military
Intelligence Division of the War Department began soon
after the entry of the United States into the war. When the
National Headquarters of the League were established in Washington
in November, 1917, the National Directors conferred
with Colonel R. H. Van Deman regarding a plan for wider
service throughout the entire country. One of the National
Directors was commissioned in the army, assigned to the Military
Intelligence Division and detailed to the work of the
League. In April, 1918, a department of the League was installed
in the Military Intelligence Division, and since then the
work has constantly grown in volume. A Captain in the
Military Intelligence is now in charge, and at the present time
thirty-six employes are working in the Section.</p>

<p>The increase in the volume of work is clearly shown by the
records. Investigations directed by the Section in May, 1918,
numbered 819; in June, 1777; in July, 2382; in August, 3617;
in September, 6736; and in October, 6604. These investigations
were of applicants for overseas service for the Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A.,
Red Cross, Knights of Columbus, Jewish Welfare, Salvation
Army, and other civilian organizations; of applicants for commissions
and employment in various Departments of the
Army, including the Quartermaster Department, Surgeon General’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
Office, Department of Aeronautics, Ordnance Department,
Signal Corps, Army Chaplain Service, Chemical Warfare
Service, etc. They also included investigations on counter-espionage
matters, German propaganda, deserters, slackers and
various other miscellaneous cases, all of which was made at
the direct request of the heads of the different sections of the
Military Intelligence Division at Washington.</p>

<p>The character of this work differs in no way from that of the
Department of Military Intelligence having to do with Negative
Intelligence. In the one hundred local divisions referred
to, the number of cases investigated and reported upon were
62,888, and upon the percentage basis, the number handled
throughout the country would be 440,216.</p>

<p>The League has likewise exerted itself in enlisting the aid of
the public in reporting enemy activities, disloyalties and
evasions of the war statutes. In various cities, bulletins have
been posted in prominent places, including street cars, office
buildings and places of public gathering, requesting citizens to
report to the American Protective League all such cases coming
to their knowledge. Much important information resulted
from this practice.</p>

<p>Because of the fact that the members of the League continue
to follow their daily vocations and maintain their normal connections
with the community, they are afforded unusual opportunities
for the investigation of radical organizations of all
kinds. The League has been able to introduce members into
all of the more important organizations, and to report upon
their policies and activities as well as upon the activities of
individual members. The number of investigations of this
character carried on in the one hundred divisions referred to
were 3,645; or 25,515 for the entire country. As most of these
were extended, and in many cases involved a complete report
upon the local organization as a whole, the figures represent
a very considerable amount of work. Under this heading are
included investigations of the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W., the W.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;U., pacifist
organizations of many kinds, the Peoples Council, the League
of Humanity, the Non-Partisan League, the Russellites and
certain Socialistic movements. Sabotage investigations and
conscientious objectors are also included.</p>

<p>In connection with the development of the overseas service
of the Red Cross, Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A., Knights of Columbus, Jewish
Welfare, Salvation Army and other civilian organizations of
like character, the necessity arose for the careful investigation
of the character, history and connections of civilian applicants
to such service. Fortunately, the Military Intelligence finally
took over the entire work of passing upon the character and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
loyalty of applicants, and relieved the League of the responsibility
of directly advising the organizations concerned of the
outcome of the investigations. The Military Intelligence then
called upon the League as its agent to make the larger part
of the investigations. By this method the name of the investigator
and of the individual responsible for the decision
remains undisclosed, and the judgment is in that sense impersonal.</p>

<p>The League likewise made investigations of a large number
of applicants for commissions in various Divisions of the
War Department, including applicants for Chaplaincies.</p>

<p>Investigations as to character and loyalty reached a very
large total. The number aggregates 30,166, including certain
investigations made prior to the establishment of the League
section in the Military Intelligence Division at Washington.</p>

<p>On January 12, 1918, the National Directors issued a bulletin
calling upon all local divisions to make full report upon the
rumors, current in their communities, which were harmful to
the interest of the United States in the prosecution of the
war. As a result of this inquiry, a large amount of information
was gathered, complete copies of which were turned
over to the Military Intelligence Division for its files.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that a large number of members of the
American Protective League enlisted in the military service
or were inducted into the draft, the League was requested by
the Military Intelligence Division to procure the names of all
such men, with their record, in order that the Military Intelligence
might avail itself of their services within the military
forces if it so desired.</p>

<p>In addition to the foregoing, miscellaneous investigations
for the Military Intelligence were carried on in considerable
volume. These included cases of impersonation of army officers,
visé of passports, bribery, theft and embezzlement, and
a variety of other cases. These miscellaneous investigations
in the local divisions referred to aggregate 19,556, or 136,892
for the country at large.</p>

<p>On June 5, 1917, the date of the first registration, approximately
eighty thousands of members of the League throughout
the country assisted at the registration polls, giving advice
and assistance to registrants under the law and aiding the
officials in all possible ways. In the larger cities, particularly
those with large foreign born populations, great congestion
resulted because of the ignorance of the law and its provisions
on the part of registrants, and because of the difficulty
in ascertaining and transcribing correctly their names
and other information regarding them. The number of places<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
for registration proved insufficient because of the shortness
of the hours, and in many places great confusion resulted.
Acting under proper instructions, members of the League in
large numbers served as volunteer registrants under the direction
of the officials.</p>

<p>On February 6, 1918, the Provost Marshal General and the
Attorney General of the United States united in a request to
the American Protective League to coöperate with all local
and district exemption boards throughout the United States
in locating and causing to present themselves to the proper
authorities delinquents under the Selective Service Regulations,
including those classed as deserters. Thereupon each
local division assigned certain members to the Local and District
Boards within its jurisdiction. These activities are of
many varieties and include the investigation of Board Members,
conspiracies and bribery, conspiracies to obstruct the
draft, draft evasion in all forms, fraudulent attempts at deferred
classification, false claims for exemption, failures to
report for examination, failures to report for mobilization,
failures to file questionnaires, failures to register, failures to
secure final classification, failures to notify local boards of
changes in address, failures to ascertain present status from
the Local Board, failures to entrain, and all other alleged
infractions of the regulations. These investigations made by
the one hundred local divisions total 323,349. Upon a percentage
basis, the cases handled throughout the country would
total 2,263,443, and including the slacker raids, an enormous
figure which cannot well be estimated.</p>

<p>Many investigations under the Local Boards were made
with extreme difficulty because of the confusion in the spelling
of names, inaccurate records and constantly shifting
addresses due to the roaming character of the individual.
We believe that the Provost Marshal General’s office will
confirm the statement that the number of delinquents and
deserters of this character is very great, possibly exceeding
two hundred thousands, a group recruited mostly from
laborers, harvesters and the other ranks of homeless unskilled
labor. Members of the League have given a great
amount of time and energy to these cases.</p>

<p>During the two or three months following the day of first
registration, a general effort was made by local divisions of
the League in the principal cities to run down those individuals
within the draft age who had failed to register on
June 5, 1917. In Chicago, a city-wide drive was made during
which all stations of the railroads entering Chicago were
covered by League operators, and the downtown or loop district<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
was likewise patroled. This was the first organized
effort on a large scale to enforce the regulations. Subsequently
similar action was taken in other cities.</p>

<p>In the early summer and fall of 1918 many slacker drives
were conducted throughout the country. They were made
under the direction of the officials of the Department of Justice
with the active assistance of the Local Divisions of the
American Protective League. Effective drives occurred in
Cleveland, Detroit, St. Louis, Philadelphia, New York, Chicago,
Minneapolis, St. Paul, Davenport, Dayton and many
cities of lesser size throughout the country.</p>

<p>As a result of a single drive in one city, according to the
report of the Division Superintendent of the Bureau of Investigation
of the Department of Justice, approximately five
hundred men were sent to camp as deserters and four thousand
delinquents were apprehended. These drives as a whole
were carried on with the acquiescence and with the general
satisfaction of the public at large, and with the minimum
of embarrassment to the individuals concerned. The
New York city drive presented an exception where certain
difficulties arose.</p>

<p>As a result of these drives, several hundred thousand men
were examined throughout the country; tens of thousands
who had failed to comply with the requirements of the Selective
Service Regulations were compelled to go to their District
Boards to make good their delinquencies, and many
thousand delinquents and deserters were inducted into the
army who otherwise might have escaped service.</p>

<p>Members of the League have apprehended many camp deserters
and soldiers absent without leave. They have investigated
thousands of requests for furloughs where the soldier
claimed illness at home or made other claims. Many fraudulent
requests were uncovered by these investigations. These
investigations, in the one hundred divisions referred to, number
3,478.</p>

<p>Early in April, 1918, the National Directors conferred with
Mr. Fosdick and other officials of the Department of Training
Camp activities, and with the officials of the Department of
Justice, with regard to developing a plan for the successful
enforcement of Section 13 of the Selective Service Act and
the regulations thereunder,—the section referred to having
to do with the protection of the military and naval forces
of the United States from the evil influences of vice and prostitution
in the vicinity of the camps. In the one hundred
divisions referred to, the number of investigations was 5,866,
or in the country at large, 41,062.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>In addition to the foregoing, the reports from local divisions
indicate that they have made a large number of investigations
of a general character for the War Department, including
a variety of subjects. Mention should also be made of
a considerable amount of service rendered to the Foreign
Recruiting Missions in locating slackers and deserters and
in making miscellaneous investigations of individuals.</p>

<p>On March 18, 1918, the Military Intelligence Branch of the
War Department requested the American Protective League
to procure for that Department, for immediate use for intelligence
purposes, photographs, drawings and descriptions of
bridges, buildings, towns and localities, then occupied by the
German forces in France, Belgium and Luxemburg, and likewise
in that portion of Germany lying west of a line running
north and south through Hamburg. In compliance with
that request, National Headquarters issued a bulletin to all
Local Divisions, calling upon the entire organization of the
League throughout the country to engage in the work, and
prescribing a detailed method for carrying it on. The result
of the work, and the appreciation of the Military Intelligence
Branch, was expressed to the League in a letter from
Lieutenant Colonel Coxe, under date of June 11, 1918, in which
he quotes a letter from Colonel Nolan, chief of the Military
Intelligence Force abroad, to the effect that the material
contained much information of value and that “the citizens of
the United States who donated the above articles and the
League which collected them have done something which definitely
helps toward the success of the operations of our
army.”</p>

<p>Summing up the actual investigations made by the American
Protective League in the one hundred local divisions
referred to, the grand total of cases reported by these divisions
is 448,950. As has been shown, the jurisdiction of these divisions
embraces approximately one-seventh of the whole population
of the country covered by all of the local divisions of
the League, and while some of the work reported by the one
hundred divisions is not duplicated elsewhere, yet the reverse
is true, and it may fairly be said that the entire number
of cases handled by the League for the War Department
throughout the country is seven times the above figure, or
more than three million.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we beg to state that it has been the policy to
coöperate with all local, State and Federal departments in
enforcing the war laws of the United States. Our Local
Chiefs have been able to establish cordial relations with all
local police, sheriffs, fish and game wardens, fire wardens,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
and other officials whose assistance has been invaluable in
many cases, and have likewise gained the friendly interest
and support of County and State officials generally as well as
of the Judicial Departments.</p>

<p>We have not attempted to set forth in this communication
the volume of work done for the Department of Justice.</p>
</div>

<p>A very prominent phase of work in which the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
was of use to the War Department is covered very well by
the comment of the Department of Justice regarding the
law under which the American Army was raised:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The most important of the war laws is the selective-service
act. Cases under this act are of three general kinds—first,
the violation of the act by the military eligibles themselves;
that is, the failure to register in accordance with the registration
system under the draft, the failure to file a questionnaire,
the making of false exemption claims, the failure to
report for examination, etc. As soon as a man becomes a
deserter, he comes under the jurisdiction of the military
authorities and is turned over to them. Up to that point,
however, if he does not fully comply with the law and the
Selective-Service Regulations, he is subject to prosecution
by this department. As the main object of the law is the
raising of an army and not the filling of a prison, the department
seeks to deliver to the military authorities for military
service all offenders subject to military service and physically
fit therefor, except those who willfully and rebelliously refuse
military service and can be subjected to substantial punishment.</p>

<p>The second class of cases concerns the acts of those who, not
themselves subject to military service, induce violations of
the act, such as making false exemption claims for others,
inducing others to resist military service or evade the law.
This classification also includes violations of duty on the
part of members of the exemption boards.</p>

<p>The third class of cases relates to the violation of those
sections which aim to protect training and mobilization
camps from the evil influence of the liquor traffic or prostitution
within the neighborhood of the camp. The first class
of cases has thrown upon the representatives of this department
throughout the country an immense amount of work.
This work has consisted in part of prosecuting deliberate
violations of the law. In far larger measure, however, it
has consisted in locating, apprehending, and delivering to
local boards or Army officials many thousands of men who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
for various reasons have failed to appear for physical examination,
failed to file questionnaires, etc. <i>Down to July
1, 1918, the department had thus investigated 220,747 cases
of this character and caused induction into military service
of 23,439 men.</i></p>
</div>

<p>A curious personal quality attaches to the study of the
work of the American Protective League, which is perhaps
attributable to the fact that all the members were amateurs
only and altogether unpaid. No doubt, did space and formal
limitations permit, a very widespread comment on the
personal relations of the members of the League to the
League itself would be acceptable to many readers.
Within the limits available, however, a certain martial
severity and impersonality must be employed. None the
less, there ought to be some brief mention made of the work
of the National Directors after the establishment of the
Washington office. In this connection it is fitting that the
names of those men should be mentioned who labored so
earnestly and so well to make the work of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. of vital
importance in the winning of the war.</p>

<p class="p2">The enormous growth of the American Protective League
in so short a time is sufficient evidence in itself that a vast,
pressing need existed for the service it rendered. Indeed,
the great local activity of the League became a national
activity in record time. Reports piled in from all over the
country; the detail of correspondence became enormous; the
filing of records an endless task. All at once the National
Directors of the American Protective League found they
had taken over a business—one of the largest businesses
with which any one of them had ever been identified. It
would not be too much to say that they worked day and
night for a long period. Their task was a very heavy one,
but they brought to it a knowledge of large business affairs
and a quality of perseverance which saw them through.</p>

<p>The original headquarters of the League were at 1537 Eye
Street, Northwest, an old Washington residence—a quaint
and none too convenient business home. All the directors
lived in the upper part of this building, and such was the
crowded and impractical form of Washington life at the
time that they were glad to sleep and sometimes cook their
meals in the same building where they did their work. Such
a thing as rest or leisure were unknown for two years’ time.
No one who has not been in part acquainted with Washington
in war times knows the handicap under which all such
work needed to be done. Transportation, living accommodations,
clerical help—everything, in that period of the war,
became a problem or an obstacle of a very considerable sort.
It was faith and enthusiasm which carried these men through,
as was the case with their associates all over America.</p>

<p>So, gradually, from this central office, the web of the
American Protective League was extended until it reached
into every state and territory of the Union, and until each
line of communication was one of interchange of intelligence
from and to the central headquarters. It is only by reference
to the portion of this history marked as “<a href="#BOOK_III">The Four
Winds</a>”—showing briefs of reports from all over the Union—that
any just knowledge can be gained of the tremendous
volume of work done by the central headquarters. Nor does
the assemblage offered give more than a mere indication of
that volume, because thousands of reports have, for reasons
of space, received no notice whatever, unfair as that must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
always seem to everyone identified with the compilation of
this history.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1918, headquarters were moved from 1537
Eye Street to 1719 H Street, Northwest, another old time
Washington residence of stately sort, which remained the
home of the National Headquarters until the signing of the
Armistice and the dissolution of the League itself. Here
Mr. Briggs, Captain Frey and Mr. Elting remained until the
end of the game in charge of a loyal band of workers. For
all of these men, and those associated with them, there remain
the recollection of a hectic two years of high speed
work, in connection with financial loss to everyone engaged
in it.</p>

THE LAW AND ITS NEW TEETH</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Insufficiency of the Espionage Laws at the Outbreak of the
War—Getting Results—The Amended Espionage Act—The
Law of 1798 Revived—Statement of the Attorney
General of the United States.</p>
</div>

<p>If predisposed to alien enemy sympathy, a critic might
declare that the League was made up of individual buccaneers,
who did high-handed things and escaped punishment
therefor only because of the general confusion due to a state
of war. Nothing could be more unjust or farther from the
truth than such a belief. On the contrary, the League and
the Department of Justice as well felt continually held back
and hampered by respect for laws admittedly inadequate.</p>

<p>We had matured a great system of jurisprudence, sufficient
for ordinary needs. Moreover, when war began, we
had passed more laws adjusted to the new needs; but it is a
curious fact that, threatened as we were by Germany’s perfected
system of espionage and propaganda, we had no actual
statute by which we adequately could cope with it until May,
1918—more than a year after we went to war, and less than
six months before the end of the war.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1918, the National Directors began, under
the editorship of Daniel V. Casey, the issue of a League organ
or confidential bulletin, called “The Spy Glass.” The
first number of the publication, in June of that year, took
up the amended Espionage Act, which was the base of practically
all of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. and D.&nbsp;J. work during the war.
This amendment rebuilt and stiffened the original Espionage
Act of June 15, 1917, which had been found insufficient, and
“put teeth in the law,” as the Attorney General’s office
phrased it. “The Spy Glass” printed a digest of the new
enactment, which is of essential interest at this point of the
League’s story as it determined the whole character of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
League’s later activities. This summarization of the Espionage
Act is printed as <a href="#APPENDIX_C">Appendix C</a> in the present volume.</p>

<p>Up to the close of 1917, we had had, duly amended, many
national statutes covering treason and sedition, foreign and
hostile connections, pretending to be an officer, enticing to
desertion or strikes, trespassing at military places, falsely
claiming citizenship, aiding or counseling offense, wearing
uniform unlawfully, conspiracy, neutrality, counterfeiting
seals, use of mails, trading with the enemy, censorship, foreign
language news items, sabotage, etc., as well as many
specific enactments controlling persons liable for military
service, and covering the increase of the army, the questions
of evasion, desertion, etc. These powers, broad as they were
already, were extended under the blanket power of the
Articles of War, to cover fraud, desertion, mutiny, insubordination,
misbehavior before the enemy, traitors and spies,
murder, rape and other crimes, and the general conduct and
discipline of those in military service.</p>

<p>Not even all these laws, however, were found to stand the
extreme demands put on the country by thousands of new
and wholly unforeseen exigencies. As a matter of fact, one
of the most useful of all our laws against enemy aliens and
spies was one not up-to-date at all, but dating back to Revolutionary
times; that is to say, July 6, 1798!<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>This old law was unearthed by the agents of the Department
of Justice. It gave almost blanket powers to the President
of the United States, and it was under the President’s
proclamations, based on that old law, that most of the early
internment arrests were made. The old law, long disused,
was found to work perfectly still! It was extended in force
by the regulations controlling enemy aliens.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>It became the duty of the newly organized League to take
on the accumulation of testimony under all these new laws;
and what that was to mean may be forecast from the comment
of the Attorney General of the United States in his
annual report for 1918:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The so-called Espionage Act contains a variety of provisions
on different subjects, such as neutrality, protection of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
ships in harbor, spy activities, unlawful military expeditions,
etc. Most of the cases which have arisen, however, presenting
the most complex problems, have been under the third section
of Title I of this act, which is aimed at disloyal and dangerous
propaganda.</p>

<p>This section 3 was amended by a law which became effective
May 18, 1918, commonly called the Sedition Act, which greatly
broadened the scope of the original act and brought under its
prohibitions many new types of disloyal utterance. The use
which our enemies have made of propaganda as a method of
warfare is especially dangerous in any country governed by
public opinion. During the first three years of the war, the
period of our neutrality, the German Government and its sympathizers
expended here a vast amount of money in carrying
on different types of propaganda, and these activities are a
matter of public knowledge. During our participation in the
war, section 3 and its later amendment have been the only
weapons available to this Government for the suppression of
insidious propaganda, and it is obvious that no more difficult
task has been placed upon our system of law than the endeavor
to distinguish between the legitimate expression of opinion and
those types of expression necessarily or deliberately in aid of
the enemy. The number of complaints under this law presented
to the Department of Justice has been incredibly large.</p>
</div>

<p>Such, then, was the ultimate machinery of our national
laws when, late, but with such speed as a willing Congress
could give after the gauntlet was flung and the issue joined,
we began to face in dead earnest the peril of the times. We
now had at last a full set of laws with teeth in them. But
it was a tremendous burden that the older institutions of
our administrative machinery had to carry. In sooth, the
load was too much. The machinery buckled under it. We
could not do the work we had to get done.</p>

<p>That work was more than ever had been asked of any
nation of the world. We had a mixed population of wholly
unknown disposition. Some said we delayed going to war
for so long because we were not sure our people would back
the Government. That, surely, could be the only reason for
the delay. All the races of the world were seething in rage
and jealousy. We had racial war within our borders. We
could not count on our own friends. We could not predict
as to what percent of men would be loyal to our flag. We
had two million men of German blood inside our borders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
guaranteed by their Kaiser to be loyal to Germany. And
long before we had gone to war, we had had abundant proof
of their disloyalty to us, of their hatred for Britain and
France, and their discontent with our own neutrality. We
had openly been warned by the German Kaiser that he
counted on the loyalty to Germany of many or most of these
men. Fear alone held the average pro-German back. But
it did not hold back their seasoned spies and the agents who
worked under cover. The sudden cessation of pro-German
talk which fell when we declared war deceived none but the
pacifists. The boasts of German-Americans as to their holdings
in Liberty Bonds deceived not at all the men who had
sat and listened on the inside; for even at this time the records
were piling up—records of private acts and words of
treason to America which had been noted by the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
The full record of German craft and duplicity, of treachery
and treason to America, never will be made public. It was
alike a loathsome and a dangerous thing.</p>

<p>Obviously, the hands of our Government sorely needed
upholding. Who was to do that? Who would apply all
these laws now that we had them? Who should watch two
million tight-mouthed men whose homes were here but whose
hearts were still in Germany? Who could cope with 300,000
spies, in part trained and paid spies, many of whom were
sent over to America long before Germany declared the war
which was “forced” on her?</p>

<p>That was what the American Protective League already
was doing when war was declared; it is what it has done ever
since, loyalty, patiently, indefatigably, to an enormous and
unknown extent, in an unbelievable variety of detail. If
ever you have held its members irresponsible or deemed them
actuated by any but good motives, cease to do so now. Beyond
all men of this generation they have proven that patriotism
is not dead.</p>

<p>The enforcement of the President’s proclamation governing
the conduct of enemy aliens in this country entailed a
tremendous amount of D.&nbsp;J. work, the larger part of which
devolved upon the agents of the League. Thousands of investigations
of alien Germans were made under its provisions.
Numerically speaking, however, the work in that imperatively
necessary line yielded to the more thankless labor
of slacker and deserter hunting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>The function of the League in all these matters is obvious.
No case at law will “stick” unless supported by competent
testimony. We have seen that the League was organized for
the collection of evidence, and for nothing else. Limited as
its power was, it really saved the day for our hard-pressed
country. It increased our Army by many thousands of
evaders whom it found and turned over to the military
authorities. It put hundreds of aliens into internment. It
apprehended plotters and prevented consummation of conspiracies
beyond number. It kept down the danger of that
large disloyal element, and held Germany in America safe
while we went on with the open business of war in the field.
It is by no means too much to say that much of the Kaiser’s
disappointment over his German-American revolt was due
not so much to any loyalty to the American flag—for of all
of our racial representatives, the Germans are the most clannishly
and tenaciously loyal to their own former flag—as it
was to fear of the silent and stern hand searching out in the
dark and taking first one and then another German or pro-German
away from the scenes that erstwhile had known him.
It was <i>fear</i> that held our enemy population down—<i>fear</i> and
nothing else. It was the League’s silent and mysterious
errand to pile up good reason for that fear.</p>

<p>At the crack of war, certain hundreds of dangerous aliens
were interned at once. They simply vanished, that was all,
behind the walls of camps or of prisons. It will be mistaken
mercy if we shall not deport thousands more when we shall
have the time deliberately to do that. <i>Fear</i> is the one thing
such men understand. Honor and loyalty, terms interdependent
and inseparable, are unknown to them. Too many
Germans loved America only because they made money
easily here. Their real flag still was across the sea, except
as they had raised it here in their churches and their schools.</p>

<p>It was sometimes rumored that many spies were shot
secretly in America. That would have been done in Germany—as
witness the deaths of Edith Cavell and others.
It was not done here. We did not kill a single spy, a single
traitor,—more is the pity. By reason of the fact that we
had outspied Germany’s vaunted espionage, we nipped in
the bud none knows how many plots and conspiracies which
otherwise would have matured in ruin to life and property.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
We did not shoot known spies, but we garroted them in the
dark and hurried them to jail. That agency of the law is
best, after all, which keeps crime from becoming crime. We
did not wait for overt acts—we filled our prisons before the
acts were done! That is why the public was obliged to romance
as to German spies. They are in jail. The report of
the Department of Justice itself, of June, 1918, on these war
activities will in this connection prove interesting reading:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>During the period of American neutrality many persons
were prosecuted for criminal acts connected with efforts to aid
the belligerents. Some of these cases were still pending when
the United States declared war on Germany. A very satisfactory
standard of success was attained in the ante-bellum
prosecutions. Almost before the ink had dried on the proclamation
of April 6, 1917, a select company of dangerous Germans
were gathered in by the United States Marshals. These
prisoners were believed to be potential, and in some cases
actual leaders of pro-German plots and propaganda. Subsequent
discoveries have quite fully confirmed this belief.
Recently a most authoritative document was found to contain
among other matters the names of several gentlemen whom the
German Government trusted to carry on its work here unofficially
after the withdrawal of the official representatives.
Of these, all were arrested on April 6, 1917, save one who had
already left the country. This disposal of the German leaders
had effects which have been continually reflected in the disjointed
and sporadic character of hostile outbreaks.</p>

<p>One of the most recent, most novel, and most important of
the Department’s efforts is the denaturalization of disloyal
citizens of foreign origin. Many natives of Germany or Austria,
sheltered from summary internment by their acquired
citizenship and clever enough to avoid the commission of
actual crime, have insulted and injured this government at
every opportunity. <i>Fortunately the naturalization law contains
a clause permitting the cancellation of citizenship papers
obtained by fraud.</i> Without waiting for further legislation,
which is apparently on the way, the Department has assailed
a number of defendants believed to have made fraudulent
mental reservations of loyalty to their native countries. Several
of these cases have already ended victoriously for the
government. More than one defeated defendant has been
interned.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the summary arrests have continued. From week
to week through 1917 their numbers steadily increased. Since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
about the beginning of 1918, the rate has been more nearly
constant.</p>

<p>Extremists have advocated the universal internment of alien
enemies, somewhat after the English practice. Now, Great
Britain interned permanently rather fewer than seventy thousand
alien enemies. <i>The United States would be compelled to
intern at least eight hundred thousand Germans and more than
twice as many Austrians.</i> The colossal expense of maintaining
this horde in idleness—civilian prisoners of war are far
more useless than convicts, because they may not be forced
to work—is too obvious to need discussion.</p>

<p>More temperate critics say that there have been too few
arrests, too low a proportion of internments, and too high a
proportion of paroles. As to the first and second charges, it
is a sufficient answer that conditions have improved instead
of becoming worse. A policeman’s record should not be judged
by the number of people he has put in jail, but by the kind of
order maintained on his beat.</p>

<p>In his annual report, issued December 5, 1918, subsequent
to the signing of the armistice, the Attorney General stated
that six thousand alien enemies had been arrested on presidential
warrants, based on the old law of 1798. Of these, a
“considerable number” were placed in the internment camps
in charge of the Army. The majority of these were German
men and women, with a certain number of Austro-Hungarians.
He concludes: “I do not want to create the impression
that there is no danger from German spies and German
sympathizers. There are thousands of persons in this country
who would injure the United States in this war if they
could do so with safety to themselves. However, they are
no more anxious to be hanged than you are.”</p>

<p>The foregoing will show, to any student of the strange and
complex situation which has confronted America at home
these last four years, the main facts as to the emergencies
we met and the means by which we met them.</p>

<p>The surprising thing is that we Americans have not known
ourselves! A thoughtful study of the American Protective
League is not a mere yawning over phrases of the law any
more than it is a mere dipping into exciting or mystifying
experiences. It is more than that. It is an excursion into
a new and unexplored region in America—into the very
heart of America itself.</p>

GERMAN PROPAGANDA</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>How the Poison was Spread—The Press—The Pulpit—The
Word-of-Mouth Rumor—Various Canards Directed
Against American Morale—Stories and Instances of the
Hun’s Subtlety.</p>
</div>

<p>Germany made two mistakes—one in beginning the war,
the other in losing it. The world has reckoned with her far
otherwise than as she hoped. Now she learns what it is to
feel defeat. Shrewd as the shrewdest, more patient than the
most patient, not lacking courage while victory was with her—yet
always showing that peculiar German clumsiness of
intellect—Germany fought with trained skill on both sides
the sea. The world knows the story of the battles in France.
Let us now study the battles fought in silence in America.</p>

<p>In actual practice the various secret methods which the
Germans employed in America could not always be defined
one from the other. A certain confusion and over-lapping
existed between the spy systems and those of propaganda
and sabotage. Often one man might practice all three.
The purpose of this chapter is to take the humblest form
of German secret work in America, that practiced by the
least skilled and most numerous branch of her spies—the
sort of thing which usually is classified as propaganda.</p>

<p>Let no one undervalue the work of propaganda. No army
is better than its morale, and no army’s morale is better than
that of the people which send it to the front. The entire
purpose of enemy propaganda is to lessen the morale either
of an army or a people; and that precisely was Germany’s
purpose with us.</p>

<p>Anything is good propaganda which makes a people nervous,
uneasy or discontented. Many of the stories which Germany
spread in America seemed clumsy at first, they were
so easily detected. Yet they did their work, even though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
sometimes it would have seemed that the rumors put out
were against Germany and not for her. These rumors, repeated
and varied, did serve a great purpose in America—they
made us restless and uneasy. That certainly is true.</p>

<p>One of the favorite objects of the German propaganda was
the Red Cross work. Hardly any American but has heard
one or other story about the Red Cross. The result has been
a very considerable lessening of the public confidence in that
great organization. The average man never runs down any
rumor of this sort. At first he does not believe what he
hears. At the fourth or fifth story of different sorts, all
aiming at one object, he begins to hesitate, to doubt. Without
any question, the Red Cross has suffered much from
German propaganda. Not that this organization should be
called perfect, for such was not the case with any war organization.
Not that the Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A. work was perfect, for it
was far from that. But the point is that all of these organizations,
all the war charities, all the war relief organizations,
were more nearly perfect than German propaganda has allowed
us to believe. The most cruel and malicious statements
against the Red Cross, wholly without foundation,
were made, with apparent feeling of all lack of responsibility,
by German-loving persons in all parts of the country. A
complaint came to Washington Headquarters all the way
from Portland, Oregon. Comment is unnecessary:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am informed that one Bertha <span class="nowrap">A——</span>, who is in the
Government service, Bureau of Aircraft Production, Executive
Department, Cable Section, office in “D” Building, 4½ Missouri
Avenue, Washington, D. C., has written a letter to a friend of
hers here that a ward in one of the hospitals in Washington
had been set aside for some seventy-five girls who were working
in the different bureaus in Washington and had become
pregnant since arriving in Washington; and that it was rumored
that there were about three hundred in addition to the
above who had been sent home for the same reason. Would
suggest that she be interviewed. We will look up her antecedents
here and if possible secure the letter which she has
written or copy thereof. Upon being advised that such a
letter had been written, I interviewed the husband of the
lady to whom the letter was written, he being bailiff in one
of the circuit courts here, and he stated that the quotation as
made above was substantially correct.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>Nearly everyone has heard the story of the Red Cross
sweater which had a five-dollar bill pinned to it for the
lucky unknown soldier who might be the recipient. This
sweater is always reported to have been sold and to have
turned up in some part of America with the proof attached
to it. In no instance has there been any foundation for this
rumor. A like baselessness marks the stories of Red Cross
graft and misappropriation of funds and waste of money.
No doubt there was a certain amount of inefficiency in this
work; but that the Red Cross was looted or conducted by
dishonest persons was never believed to be true even by the
German agents who started the stories.</p>

<p>During the time of the influenza epidemic, a common story
was that doctors had been found spreading influenza germs
in the cantonments. It was reported, as no doubt every
reader will remember, that two doctors had been shot in one
post. Sometimes the story would come from a man who got
it from an enlisted man who had been one of the firing squad
who had executed several doctors in this way. There was
not a word of truth in any of this. The inoculation propaganda
was German propaganda, pure and simple. It might
not seem clear how such mendacity could be of direct help
to Germany; but it had this result—it made American mothers
and fathers more uneasy about their sons. It made
them want to keep their boys at home.</p>

<p>The powdered glass rumor was one of the most widely
spread instances of German propaganda. Who has not
heard it divulged in secrecy by some woman, with the injunction
that not a word must be said about it? A German
nurse had been detected putting powdered glass in the
rolled surgical bandages in the Red Cross work rooms. She
had disappeared before she could be arrested, and she had
not left her name. That mysterious German woman who
worked with the Red Cross is still absent. The rumors of
powdered glass in bandages have been practically groundless—only
one division, that in upper New Jersey, reports
any case of that sort actually run down. The charges of
powdered glass in food sent to the soldiers or put in tinned
goods have been found equally baseless. Two cases of glass
found in food stuffs are authentically reported,—both accidents,
and the glass was broken and not powdered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>The charges of poisoned wells around cantonments was
another canard. Rumors came out that horses, and men
also, had been killed by the poisoned water. The entire
investigating force of the United States has found one case
of poisoned water in a horse trough in West Virginia—and
no horse drank of it. The charges about poisoned court-plaster
were proved to be equally groundless—indeed, they
would seem to be of small reason in any case, because, if
Germany was putting out the court-plaster, why should she
speak of it; and why should America put it out at all? The
psychology of it is this: anything which makes the people
feel uneasy or anxious is good propaganda for the enemy.</p>

<p>Stories were spread very widely at one time that Canada
and England were not practicing food conservation—that we
were shipping our food to England and she was eating it
without reservation, whereas we were denying ourselves
sugar and butter. Perhaps you had best talk with someone
who lived in England during the war as to the truth of that.
It was one of the many German lies. There was the charge
that the price of gasoline was due to the fact that the Standard
Oil Company was dumping and wasting large quantities
of gasoline. There was nothing in that, of course.</p>

<p>The report of Polish pogroms, general Jew killing expeditions
by the Poles, were magnified and distorted, all with
the purpose of making both the Poles and Jews dissatisfied
with the conduct of the war. Continually these anti-Ally
stories got out, and always they were hard to trace.</p>

<p>This form of propaganda, spread by word of mouth, was
the most insidious and most widely spread of all forms. It
was of course, made the more easy by the excited state of
mind of the people during war times. You will remember
that you yourself bought more newspapers than you ever
did in your life—you looked for new headlines, new sensations,
all the time. At home, your wife also was eager for
sensations, for the news, for the gossip. It was ready for
her and every member of her family, and her neighbors and
neighbors’ families. The spread of a rumor is not governed
by the laws of evidence; and hearsay testimony rarely is
given twice the same—it always grows.</p>

<p>Into this form of German propaganda came spite work
against German-Americans who themselves were loyal. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
great deal of League activity had to do with running down
rumors against persons declared to be pro-German. Sometimes
these things were found baseless; and again enough
pro-Germanism was found to warrant a stern rebuke.</p>

<p>Sometimes, public speakers, well trained in their tasks,
put out propaganda which at the time seemed an innocent
statement of facts. To the Lake Placid Club of New York
came a certain “Belgian officer” who spoke very good English,
and who purported to be able to tell all about the war.
He made a long speech, regarding which many members of
the local Red Cross complained bitterly to the American
Protective League. This man’s talk, while purporting to be
that of an ally of this country, was really German propaganda.
He denied or justified German atrocities, deplored
Red Cross knitting, declared it would take ten million Americans
to beat the Germans; that they were going into a hell
of vermin, dirt and disease; that our army as yet was difficult
to find. There was a German orchestra at the Club,
supposed to have come from the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
They all applauded vociferously when the speaker
made such statements as, “After the war there will be a
day of reckoning.” Further details, which proved that this
speaker really was spreading German propaganda, led to
his being traced to New York. He was found to have worked
at different times in Iowa, Kansas, and elsewhere. The last
report was that he was supposed to have sailed for his native
country.</p>

<p>There was no way, shape nor manner in which Germany
did not endeavor to embarrass us. She had, besides her carefully
trained public speakers, her secret workers who had
assigned to them definite objectives. For instance, it was
known that the negro race would furnish a considerable
number of soldiers for our army. A very wide German
propaganda existed among the negroes in Georgia and Carolina,
and in such northern cities as Indianapolis, where large
numbers of that race were located. A certain German was
indicted under seven counts for this manner of activity. It
was proved that he had told a great many negro privates in
the army that they would be mutilated if captured, and
that they were going to starve to death in France if they
ever got across. The horrors of war with the American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
forces were pointed out to these simple people; but, on the
other hand it was explained to them that if they would
work for the German interests, they would be allowed to set
up a government of their own in America if Germany won
the war! They were told Germany loved the negroes and
believed in their equality with the white race in every way,
and would support their government when once her war was
won! One such secret German worker among colored soldiers
and civilians was M. <span class="nowrap">F——</span> of New York, indicted
under seven counts in June, 1918, under the new
Espionage Law. <span class="nowrap">F——</span> put out much the same story to
frighten the negroes and make them discontented—wholesale
mutilation at the hands of Germans if they were captured in
France. He declared that their eyes would be gouged out
and their ears cut off. He also said that Germany was allowing
our transports to reach Europe unharmed because
she wanted a lot of Americans in France, where, after cutting
off their supplies, she intended to starve them all to
death.</p>

<p>This looks like making out a bad case for Germany—but
softly. <span class="nowrap">F——</span> also said that, on the other hand, Germany
did not want to kill the negroes if they would not fight;
that if only they would work for Germany’s interests, they
should have their own country and their own government.
Stories like this were circulated in the South and among
cities in the North with a heavy negro population. <span class="nowrap">F——</span>
was the first propagandist to be caught with the goods. He
was talking much with colored privates in the draft army.</p>

<p>Of course, a prime object of propaganda was to obstruct
the draft and to prevent the shipment of munitions. It
largely failed, as everyone knows. But still it cannot be
said that Germany did not invest such money well as she
spent on her secret pro-German propaganda in America.
She knew that she had ruined Russia by propaganda. We
might further have learned the danger of propaganda as a
weapon had we heard the rumor that Germany herself had
her collapse hastened by propaganda which Great Britain
managed to spread among her people. It is a matter of history
that German propaganda caused the Italian debacle in
the first Austrian advance into Italy.</p>

<p>Nor is it to be believed that Germany has ceased in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
propaganda. She does not believe herself defeated even
now. The undying occult spirit of the old Teutonic Knights
still lives to-day in America. Now, you will begin to hear
attempts to make us dislike England, attempts to incite Ireland
to revolt against England, attempts to make us dislike
France, stories that England and France owe us much for
everything they gave us in the way of equipment, aeroplanes,
munitions; stories that we will never get back any of the
moneys we loaned to the Allies; stories of how simple and
innocent the German people are, how anxious they are to
be friendly to America. That is all propaganda. By this
time we ought to know how to value it.</p>

<p>Of course, the German language papers in this country
were hotbeds of propaganda and sedition. Some of them
were suppressed by the censorship, some by the indignant
American people who informed the courts of justice. Most
of them by this time have become tame since they have seen
the penitentiary sentences imposed upon the more outspoken
of these German editors living in America. These foreign
language papers were prominent in New York, Chicago,
Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and other cities. They
show the strength of German sentiment in America. Every
one of them was a center of propaganda, at first outspoken,
then more careful. The great majority of these papers, in
order to protect their business investments, tried to cover up
when they found which way the wind was setting. The
censorship officers were flooded with complaints against these
papers. For instance, there came all the way from Indianapolis
a complaint against a paper printed in Baltimore,
Maryland, “The Bavarian Weekly.” A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. had many
extended translations of articles printed in this paper, the
general tenor of which was a laudation of Germany and
German methods. One wonders what Germany would have
done to any American newspaper printed within the confines
of Germany which might have expressed such hostile
sentiments against the country harboring it.</p>

<p>In addition to these, there were, of course, the English
language papers which for one reason or another were
covertly or outspokenly in favor of Germany. Papers all
the way from New York to Pueblo, Colorado, were bought
or were attempted to be bought outright by German capital.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
The most sensational scandals of this sort came out of New
York.</p>

<p>It is known that in many towns the German element
undertook to sow seeds of discontent in the minds of savings
bank depositors. Rumors got out—no one could tell
where they started—to the effect that the United States
Government was going to confiscate all the savings of the
people; that the bonds would never be paid off. Of course,
all this was absurd, but it had its effect upon servant girls
and others who were loyally putting their savings into the
securities of the government. It cost a great deal of time
and expense to run down such rumors.</p>

<p>The pulpit was a recognized part of the German system
of spy work in America, as has elsewhere been noted. It
is not just to accuse all Lutheran ministers of desecrating
the cloth they wore. There are good Lutheran ministers
who are loyal Americans without question. At the same
time it is true that more charges have been brought against
pastors of the Lutheran church, and charges of more specific
nature, than against any other class or profession in
our country. There are scores and hundreds of such reports
which came into the National Headquarters of the
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. from all parts of the country, more especially
those parts which have heavy German settlements. These
are so numerous that one cannot avoid calling the Lutheran
pulpit in America one of the most active and poisonous
influences which existed in America during the war. A
sample report comes in from the Chief of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. at
Armour, S. D.:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have reported on five German Lutheran preachers of this
vicinity. They are all of the same stripe—profess loyalty, but
actions speak otherwise. It seems strange to me that they
have such an anxiety to get into active war work in the army
and navy.</p>
</div>

<p>In yet another and longer specification, the same chief
states:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am becoming concerned about the large number of
reports I get locally regarding German Lutheran ministers in
this part of South Dakota. They are attempting to obtain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
positions of trust in Government work in the army and navy.
<i>I would not trust one of them in this part of the State. We
have had trouble continually with the German communities
where these ministers are located.</i> Twenty-nine were convicted
from Tripp.... Our Government might as well
choose men from Berlin as to select German Lutheran ministers
from this part of South Dakota. It seems to me that
the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. should investigate and see what is inducing all
these German Lutheran ministers to apply for Government
positions. If even one succeeds in obtaining an appointment,
it would be an opening.</p>
</div>

<p>This matter went before the Military Intelligence Division
in Washington and received proper handling there.</p>

<p>A report from Osage, Iowa, came in against a certain
priest in another Iowa town. The entire record of this
man is given, besides other details regarding his parentage,
his education, and his conduct of his church. “Previous
to the entry of the United States into the war, he upheld
Germany in all particulars. Since war has been declared,
he has been more careful in his speech. A service flag was
dedicated in our village, which consists of but one street.
The ceremonies were held in front of this man’s house. He
did not attend the services. The next Sunday he roasted
his congregation for giving money toward the flag and told
them they should give quite as much to the church. A
committee of five men visited him and invited him to subscribe
to the Third Loan.”</p>

<p>One of these clerical gentlemen who have remained loyal
to the Kaiser, though not to Christ, is the Reverend John
Fontana, Lutheran clergyman of New Salem, North Dakota.
He was convicted for preaching sedition, and got a
three-year sentence in a Federal Court. This did not deter
his likewise loyal Kaiserliche congregation. By a vote of
fifty-seven to twenty-two the members decided to continue
him as their beloved pastor. Yet this is what Judge Amidon
said to Fontana when he was arraigned,—words which
ought to be printed in large letters and displayed prominently
in every street of every city of every portion of
America. The Judge said to the prisoner:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You received your final papers as a citizen in 1898. By the
oath which you then took, you renounced and abjured all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
allegiance to Germany and the Emperor of Germany, and
swore that you would bear true faith and allegiance to the
United States. What did that mean? That you would set
about earnestly growing an American soul, and put away your
German soul.</p>

<p>Have you done that? I do not think you have. You have
cherished everything German and stifled everything American.
You have preached German, prayed German, read German,
sung German. Every thought of your mind and every emotion
of your heart through all these years has been German. Your
body has been in America, but your life has been in Germany.
You have influenced others who have been under your ministry
to do the same thing.</p>

<p>There have been a good many Germans before me in the last
month. They have lived in this country, like yourself, ten,
twenty, thirty, forty years, and they have had to give their
evidence through an interpreter. It has been an impressive
part of the trial. As I looked at them and tried, as best I
could, to understand them, there was written all over every
one of them, “Made in Germany.” American life had not
dimmed that mark in the least.</p>

<p>I do not blame you and these men alone. I blame myself.
I blame my country. We urged you to come; we welcomed
you; we gave you opportunity; we gave you land; we conferred
upon you the diadem of American citizenship—and
then we left you.</p>

<p>When we get through with this war, and civil liberty is
made safe once more upon this earth, there is going to be a
day of judgment in these United States. Foreign-born citizens
and the institutions which have cherished foreigners are
going to be brought to the judgment of this Republic. That
day of judgment looks more to me to-day like the great Day of
Judgment than anything that I have thought of for many
years. There is going to be a separation on that day of the
sheep from the goats. Every institution that has been engaged
in this business of making foreigners perpetual in the United
States will have to change—or cease. That is going to cut
deep, but it is coming.</p>
</div>

<p>It must be pointed out that in spite of this charge of
the judge, and in spite of the sentence of this minister of
the gospel, his flock remained loyal to him and invited him
back to preach when he got out of jail!</p>

<p>It has always been charged against the Germans in
America that they were the most clannish of all the foreigners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
coming to settle in this country. They, longer than
any other people, retain their own institutions, their own
language, their own customs. In parts of the country there
are schools which teach the German language more than
they do the English—a practice which, in all likelihood,
will be discontinued when the troops come back from
France and Germany. Without any doubt or question,
pro-German school teachers were German propagandists,
usually of the indiscreet and hotheaded sort.</p>

<p>From Terre Haute, Indiana, comes a complaint regarding
Miss Lena Neubern—that is what we will call her—a hot
socialist and worse, who was a school teacher. Miss Neubern
had two brothers in that city who refused to allow an
American flag to be placed in front of their store, or to
allow their clerks to attend the parade of the Third Liberty
Loan. A committee of citizens called on them and told
them “in strong term what was expected of them.” Miss
Neubern taught her school children, Americans, that the
“Kaiser was just as good a man as President Wilson; that
the United States was in this war, not for democracy, but
for commercial supremacy; that the United States was as
greedy as Germany; that we were controlled by England,
always the enemy of the United States.” Miss Neubern
refused to allow the Star Spangled Banner to be sung in
her room, and did all she could to hinder the sale of Thrift
Stamps among the children, though in other schools large
numbers of stamps had been sold. This active and intelligent
young woman pleaded guilty of this charge and was
dismissed by the school board. One wonders whether the
German Government would have stopped at the dismissal
in a similar instance!</p>

<p>Another form of German propagandist might have been
found higher up in educational circles. The faculties of
our great universities have always been made up in part
of a class of men who are of the belief that intellect and
scholarship are best shown by eccentricity and radicalism.
More than that, we had a number of actual Germans in
our university faculties in America. Since it is the proposition
here to deal in concrete facts and not in mere general
assertions, let us print something which came in,
embodied in the report from Champaign, Illinois.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>Champaign, Illinois, is the home of the University of
Illinois, and for some reason university towns seem to act
as chutes for all sorts of independent thought. There are
two strong German settlements in Champaign County, and
a very strong German settlement in the city, where many
residents have shown very pro-German tendencies. These
German settlements have their own German schools, taught
by their German Lutheran ministers under the pretense of
teaching religion. Sentiment became so intense that the
local A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. Chief was requested by the Government to
close these schools if possible. Some of them have reopened
since the armistice. In such localities the Germans have
been very independent and often quite outspoken, so that
it was necessary in many cases for the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. to use
influence to prevent violence to them. There were only
one or two cases where the citizens got out of control,
although many citizens of German descent refused to buy
bonds and made disparaging remarks regarding the war.</p>

<p>The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. Chief says: “We were confronted with
the problem of ousting five alien enemies at the University
of Illinois, two of them regarded as dangerous. We also
had to handle a cook at the aviation barracks, an alien
enemy who was deliberately wasting food. We convicted
the wife of a German minister in the Federal Court for
making disloyal remarks. We had some difficulty with
Russellites, Mennonites, and radical Socialists, but all have
been kept in hand. Our organization consists of seventy-five
members, but about twenty-five of us have done most
of the active work.” A good and worthy twenty-five.</p>

<p>The reference to Russellites and Mennonites covers two
regions of great A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. activity. Pastor Russell, as he
was known, passed away from this scene some time ago,
but he left behind him seeds of discord. He was perhaps
not so much disloyal as he was eccentric and fanatical in
his mental habit. His book, “The Finished Mystery,” was
so open a plea against war that it was proscribed by the
United States Government. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operatives ran down
a great deal of so-called pro-German talk which originated
in the Russellites. An instance of this comes from Coloma,
Michigan, which reports: “Radical socialists became active
during August, 1917. Acting under instructions from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
the Department of Justice, we put all of these meetings
out of business in the territory of our jurisdiction. No
more socialist meetings of any kind here. We got information
which resulted in my calling upon certain Russellites.
Collected five books of ‘The Finished Mystery,’ and
some copies of the ‘Kingdom News.’ Russellites were
watched, and they promised to discontinue activities until
after the war. They have done so.”</p>

<p>It is not to be denied that the following of the radical
banner among all nations of the world is an increasing one
and one which will demand great care on the part of the
governments on both sides of the Atlantic. Bolshevism is
the great threat of the day, and we shall have to meet it
in America as it must be met in Germany and Russia
before there can be any lasting peace.</p>

<p>At times some of these radicals have got caught in the
jaws of the amended Espionage Act, as for instance, Eugene
V. Debs, the veteran Socialist candidate for the presidency,
who was given three concurrent sentences of ten
years each. Early in the fall of 1918, Dr. Morris Zucker,
a well known Socialist in Brooklyn, was arrested on a
charge of sedition and locked up. He is said to have declared
that the stories of German atrocities committed by
German army officers were not true and that they were
circulated by capitalists in this country to further their
own purposes. Dr. Zucker was of the belief that American
soldiers are “make believe” soldiers. On September 6,
1918, in Philadelphia, Joseph V. Stillson, secretary of the
“Kova,” a Lithuanian newspaper, was caught by the
Espionage Act and sentenced to three years’ imprisonment
at Atlanta.</p>

<p>In Chicago, in December, 1918, there began the trial of
Victor L. Berger, Congressman-elect from Milwaukee, for
violation of the espionage act and conspiracy to obstruct
the United States in prosecuting the war with Germany.
With Berger, four other Socialist co-defendants were arraigned:
Adolph Germer, National Secretary of the Socialist
party; J. Louis Engdahl, Editor of the <i>American
Socialist</i>; William F. Kruse, Secretary of the draft-evading
organization of the anti-war Socialists, and Irwin St. John
Tucker, a radical Episcopalian rector.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>The trial before Federal Judge Kenesaw M. Landis lasted
for more than a month and resulted in a verdict of guilty
against all of the defendants. On February 20, 1918, Judge
Landis sentenced the convicted men to twenty years’ imprisonment
in the federal penitentiary at Fort Leavenworth,
Kansas. In sentencing the men, Judge Landis said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Their writings and utterances fairly represent the consistent,
personal campaigns they conducted to discredit the cause of
the United States and obstruct its efforts. By no single word
or act did they offer help to the country to win the war. It
was a conscious, continuous plan to obstruct the country’s
military efforts. What has been said in this courtroom by
the defendants is but an apology by them for obstructing the
country’s effort.</p>
</div>

<p>The convicted men were granted an appeal to the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals by Judge Samuel Alschuler.
In the upper court the defendants were compelled
to give their personal pledge to Judge Alschuler that
neither by word or act would they do any of the things
for which they have been convicted, pending the final disposition
of the case. It should be understood and remembered
that these men were convicted not for their personal
or political beliefs, but for violation of a law of the United
States.</p>

<p>A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. reports show that Lake Mills, Iowa, had a state
senator who advised young men that they could not be
forced to cross the water to fight, nor forced to buy Liberty
bonds. He also was alleged to have obstructed the United
War Work campaign by telling a client that he did not
need to assist. He was connected with the Non-Partisan
League and promised the farmers that they would secure
control of the Legislature. Affidavits to this effect were
handed to “D.&nbsp;J.” The Non-Partisan League was well
investigated in that neighborhood. The organizer of the
local chapter was forced to buy bonds and stamps and to
remain inactive until Peace was declared. “He moved
away and never came back,” says the local chief.</p>

<p>In another Lake Mills office, there was found by American
Protective League operatives a picture drawn by a rather
good amateur artist depicting a single German blowing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
pieces the head of an American column of troops. Investigation
showed that this picture was drawn by a clerk in a
local store. He was drafted and is in France, and the report
regarding him is filed with “D.&nbsp;J.” His original drawing
is in the possession of the National Directors of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.</p>

<p>A League report, simple and direct, which comes from
Todd County, Minnesota, is one of the best and freest expositions
of our system of government and the character of
our citizenry that may be seen in many a day. The college
professor would be valuable who could write a clearer or
more useful paper. Says the report:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Germans of the country are about evenly divided between
the Catholic and Lutheran faiths. The Scandinavians
are practically all Lutheran. The German Catholics, in general,
allied themselves with loyal element; but a majority of
the Lutherans, both German and Scandinavian, gave evidence
of pro-German sympathies.</p>

<p>To complicate matters at this time, a political movement
under socialist leadership showed great activity. The movement
was organized under the name of the Non-Partisan
League, with its platform built of essentially socialistic planks.
The League attained a membership of approximately 1,200 in
the summer of 1918. Its representatives and organizers held
meetings in every neighborhood and solicited memberships.
In the early days of our entry into the war, they demanded
the cessation of hostilities; declared that it was a rich man’s
war; denounced conscription, and were guilty of numberless
seditious utterances. Many of the greater lights of the League
came into the country and delivered addresses, among whom
were Townley, Lindbergh, Bowen, Randall and others. The
burden to the cry of these men was the iniquity of “Big Business”
and the wrongs of the farmers. As a remedy for all
these economic evils, the socialistic schemes of the League
were offered, and found acceptance among a greater number
than would have been thought possible.</p>

<p>In June, 1917, the Todd County Public Safety Commission
was organized. The loyalist element began to assert itself. A
system of education was inaugurated to offset the propaganda
of the Bolshevists. The better newspapers lent their aid, and
the Red Cross and other war activities were pushed. Many
public meetings were held, and many outside speakers assisted
in the work. The Public Safety Commission made itself felt
by many arrests. Some were fined for seditious utterances,
and some were held to the Grand Jury. Conditions in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
county were such that, while indictments were preferred by
the Grand Jury in the state courts, it was impossible in some
flagrant cases to secure a conviction by the petit jury. Such
relief as was secured was through the state courts. So far as
this county was concerned, the federal courts were useless.</p>
</div>

<p>Just how far the war is going to affect American politics
in the future is something that many a politician in
America would be exceedingly glad to know. It may be
that there will be some public men, unworthy to be called
representatives of the American people, who will cater now,
as before the war, to the German vote. We should beware
of such men, for all they can do will be to advocate that
very propaganda which to-day is matter of execration all
over the country.</p>

<p>There have not lacked men, who, more especially before
we declared war, have boasted of their German birth and
openly made that their main argument for office. In a
large Ohio city such a man ran for the mayoralty and
polled a very considerable vote. He said many times publicly
that he would not subscribe to any Liberty Loans and
was not in accord with our government. He was very
bitter in his denunciation of all who did not side with him.
He proclaimed himself a hyphenated German proud of his
native origin. He spoke before the German Sängerbund of
his city and before delegates of the German-American Alliance—and
he spoke in German—a democratic candidate
for mayor in an American city of the second class! He
uttered that old and familiar and useless plea—dangerous
in America to-day—“One can’t forget the blood that flows
in one’s veins.” Part of his campaign argument was this:
“I personally hope that the war in Europe will be a draw;
but if there must be a victory, if I must choose between
intelligent Germany and ignorant Russia, there is but one
place for me to cast my lot, and that is with the Kaiser.
If I felt otherwise, I would not be human.” What he
should have said was, if he had felt otherwise, he would
not have been German. He concluded his remarks with
the statement that if he became mayor, “Whatever interference
there has been in the past with such an organization
as I am now addressing, there will be no such interference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
when I become mayor.” But he did not become mayor.</p>

<p>It is only of late that we have heard much of the Non-Partisan
League in America, even in this day of leagues,
societies and alliances, but it has had growth and political
significance in certain of the Northwestern States. It
would not be true to charge the Non-Partisan League with
disloyalty as a body, but certainly it would be yet more
foolish to say that all its members, in the North-European
part of the United States, had been loyal to America in
this war, or free of sympathy with Germany. Read the
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. reports—they are not all shown in these pages—of
its manifold activities in sections where the Non-Partisan
League is strongest. Draw your own inferences
then, for then you will have certain premises and need not
jump at any conclusion not based on premises.</p>

<p>We may take its reports from Dakota and Iowa as fairly
good proof of the accuracy of the foregoing statements.
Let us, for instance, examine as a concrete proposition the
report from Mason City, Iowa. It is done simply; yet it
leads us directly into the heart of the problem of America’s
future and face to face with the basic questions of courage
in business and social life which must underlie the future
growth of our country. A story? It is all the story of
America.</p>

<p>This report, quite normal in all ways, would represent
the usual type of report from a nice, average agricultural
city, were it not for certain phases of the work it represents.
There were 24 alien enemy cases; 97 disloyalty
and sedition cases; 21 cases of propaganda, and eleven
I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. cases and other forms of radicalism. The state of
society reflected by these figures is best covered in the words
of the report itself:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In ante-bellum times there existed a more or less well-grounded
opinion that in this vast western farming region the
melting pot had most nearly accomplished its task and that
here, if anywhere, was a truly American community. The
citizen might be of English, Irish, Scotch, Scandinavian, German
or French birth or ancestry, but he was primarily an
American. This belief was based upon the fact that here all
American institutions and customs received hearty support,
that the people encouraged to the limit the American liberty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
of thought and action. American politics in our region was
relatively free from the corruption encouraged by a large percentage
of ignorant or apathetic voters. In fact, the population
of this region is enlightened, temperate, and prosperous—a
condition most favorable if not essential to the proper
and full development of a real Americanism.</p>

<p>What did the war bring out? Previous to the advent of
America into the war there was, on the whole, a true neutrality.
There were sympathizers and partisans of both sides
and there was an even greater class of interested spectators
who marveled at the stupendous feats of the armies of both
sides. The American declaration of war was gladly acclaimed
by the pro-Allies, cheerfully accepted as a call to duty by the
great mass of interested spectators. It immediately engaged
the support of the majority of those previously pro-German,
leaving a very small minority of pro-Germans to carry on the
propaganda against the American and Allied cause.</p>

<p>It was to deal with this small minority that we organized
in May, 1917, and began to select and swear in A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
operatives.</p>

<p>Among matters which called for constant vigilance, the Non-Partisan
League came in for a share of our attention. At the
time of the entry of the United States into the war, Iowa was
being covered with literature for and against this movement,
the leading force against the Non-Partisan League being the
Greater Iowa Association. The State Council for National
Defense considered that it was not for the good of Iowa for
this fight to continue, and passed resolutions asking both
factions to discontinue their efforts until after the war. The
Greater Iowa Association readily acceded to the request, but
the Non-Partisan League persisted in its propaganda, and the
Council for Defense deemed it wise to take a hand in fairness
to the Greater Iowa Association.</p>
</div>

<p>But the foregoing mild report does not tell the full story
in all of its acrimonious vehemence. A local agricultural
journal came out in red head-lines across its cover page,
“Iowa’s Reign of Terror!” The editor, in that and subsequent
issues, printed perhaps 50,000 words of condemnation
of those not included among his own constituents, sidetracking
alfalfa and Holsteins wholly for the time. He
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To-day in Iowa there is a veritable reign of terror, which
has been encouraged among ignorant and irresponsible people,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
by men and organizations who should and do know better, but
who are playing upon passion and prejudice for ulterior purposes.
More harm is resulting from this assumption of authority
by private individuals, without the shadow of moral or
legal right, than by all the pro-German propaganda or real
disloyalty in the state. And the worst of it is that it defeats
the very purpose which is used to excuse it—the purpose of
uniting all our citizens whole-heartedly and sincerely behind
the Government’s war aims. Already this rule of passion,
freed from legal restraint, has resulted in the excess of mob
violence, of injustice and wrongs towards loyal and patriotic
citizens, whose whole lives will be embittered by the brutal
intolerance of a few. Our boasted freedom and liberty and
love of fair play are being made the victims of methods no
better than those of the despoilers of Belgium, from which
they differ not in quality but only in degree.</p>

<p>Right to-day in Iowa, men in positions of leadership and
responsibility are fomenting and encouraging this spirit of
mob rule and terrorism, which is wholly outside the pale of
law, and which will result in such a spirit of lawlessness that
we will all pay dearly for it in the years to come. The Greater
Iowa Association and its allied organizations are among those
which are helping to create this atmosphere of dangerous suspicion
and distrust, especially towards farmers’ organizations
in Iowa, which is bound to result in bloodshed and lynch-law
if it is not quickly checked. The Greater Iowa Association
boasts in its monthly publication that it has already spent
$20,000 in helping to put down the Bolsheviki of Iowa (its
usual expression for the loyal and conservative farmers of this
state) and that it will spend $180,000 more (a total of $200,000)
for this purpose if necessary. Its sentiments are approved
and applauded by its sycophant organizations, such as the Des
Moines Chamber of Commerce, in its official monthly bulletin,
which it proclaims is “the mouthpiece for Des Moines.”</p>
</div>

<p>Tut, tut! Obviously, Mason City leads directly into a
pretty political mess. Willy-nilly, friends of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.,
if not members of the Non-Partisan League, are pushed
into ranks assigned to enemies. We may mildly animadvert
on the fact that it is the members of the Non-Partisan
League who largely buy the journal from which the foregoing
quotation is made. It has had a long and honorable
history, but is perhaps not so disinterested as the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
It does not, however, go to war with the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. so much
as with the Greater Iowa Association, which presently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
voted the editor out of membership. The American Protective
League might have been drawn into politics if it had
lived much longer—perforce would be and ought to be
drawn. One thing is sure, if a man must cater in business
to a class which has disloyalty inborn and ingrained, that
man is not catering to America and a great future for her.</p>

<p>It is all a question of the high heart of the gentleman
unafraid—individual courage, clear-headedness, honest
self-searching. That is as true for the native born as for
the naturalized citizen. Perhaps for all these warring
Iowans, some of whom were zealous and interested, there
might very well, in these grave, troubled days of our
country and of all the world, be put on the wall of our
house the old Bible motto: “Blessed are the pure in
heart.”</p>

<p>You ask, indeed, what shall we do with all these chameleon
propagandists, these foreigners? How shall we classify
them—as Americans or as enemies? Who is the
American?</p>

<p>It is simple to answer that. It is he who himself knows
in his own soul whether or not he is done with the damnable
hyphen which has almost ruined America, and yet
may do so. Liberty Bonds and public speaking do not
prove Americanism. Not even service stars in a window
make a man American. Blessed are the <i>pure in heart</i>, of
Mason City or of Des Moines, of the Greater Iowa Association
or the Non-Partisan League, of the Peoples’ Council,
of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L., or of German or American birth. And
when individual American courage is common enough to
make a man fight pro-Germanism until it is dead forever,
one thinks we shall indeed see God manifested again in
the great civilization which once was promised for America.
It can be had now in only one way, and that way will cost
dear. If you are interested in your son’s future, see to it
that he—and you yourself—shall be pure in heart. We
want and will have no others for Americans to-day or to-morrow.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>
THE GERMAN SPY CASES</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The Great Spy Cases—Details of German Propaganda—Finances
and Personnel of German Forces in America—The
Diplomatic Fiasco—Notorious Figures of Alien
Espionage Uncovered—The Senate Judicial Investigation.</p>
</div>

<p>To gain any adequate idea of the amount of the activities
which centered in New York would mean the following
out of countless concealed threads leading all over the
world and covering the United States like a net. We never
knew until we were well into this war that, long before
we dreamed of war, our country was infested by vast
numbers of the paid spies of Germany; that these worked
under a well-established, and now well-known, organization;
that the highest German diplomatic representatives
were a part of the system; that leading financial figures of
New York were figures in it also, and that the whole intricate
machine was differentiated like a great and well-ordered
business undertaking. It was an elaborate organization
for the betrayal of a country; and that organization,
like the armed forces of Germany in the field, was
beaten and broken only by the loyal men of America, resolved
once more that a government of the people should
not perish from the earth.</p>

<p>Let the scene shift from New York—whose defensive
organization has been outlined—to the national judicial
center at Washington, the seat of our intelligence system
and of those courts of law which have in charge the
national affairs. There, for many months, a few men have
sat and watched pour into their offices such proofs of
human perfidy and depravity as can never have been paralleled
in the most Machiavellian days of the Dark Ages.</p>

<p>The daily press of the United States acted under a voluntary
censorship during the war, even while it saw pass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
by such news as never before had it seen in America. Now
and again something of this would break which obviously
was public property and ought to be known—the notorious
transactions of von Bernstorff, von Papen, Dr. Albert, Boy-Ed,
Bolo; such crimes as the blowing up of the international
bridge in Maine; the mysterious fires and explosions
whose regularity attracted attention; the diplomatic
revelations regarding Dumba and Dernburg and their colleagues,
which finally resulted in the dismissal of the
clique of high German officials whose creed had been one
of diplomatic and personal dishonor.</p>

<p>The stories of German attempts to control several New
York newspapers; their efforts to buy or subsidize some
thirty other journals in all parts of the country; the well-known
subsidizing of certain writers to spread propaganda
in the press—all these things also necessarily got abroad
to such an extent that the United States Government could
not fail to take cognizance of it. At length, charges came
out linking up a Washington daily with wealthy commercial
interests of a supposedly pro-German nature, and a
great deal of acrimonious comment appeared in all parts
of the country. Washington resolved to investigate these
charges. The process took the form, in the late fall of
1918, of the appointment of a sub-committee of the great
Senate Judiciary Committee, which popularly was known
as the Overman Committee.</p>

<p>The work of this committee, which summoned before it
officers of the Attorney General’s establishment in New
York, agents of the Bureau of Investigation in Washington,
of Military and Naval Intelligence in Washington, and
all the larger figures of the accused or suspected persons
implicated in what now had become a wide-reaching
national scandal, was continued over many weeks. The
proceedings were made public regularly, and at last the
readers of America began to get, at first hand, authentic
ideas of what menace had been at our doors and inside
our doors. It was before this Overman Committee that many
of the great New York cases in which A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. assisted
passed to their final review.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important single witness called before
this Senate committee was Mr. A. Bruce Bielaski, Chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
of the Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice
at Washington. Mr. Bielaski was on the stand for days
at a time, and his testimony came as a distinct shock to
those of us who heretofore had known little or nothing
about the way in which our covert forces of espionage
were combating those of Germany. It will not be needful
to follow the records of the committee from day to day
throughout the long period of its sittings, but some of the
more important revelations made by Mr. Bielaski first may
be brought to notice.</p>

<p>It was brought into the record, for publication later by
the State Department, that there was a regular system of
secret messages between Count von Bernstorff of the Imperial
German Embassy at Washington, and the Berlin
Foreign Office, by way of South America and Stockholm.
All this time the Imperial German Ambassador was posing
as a great friend of America, while in reality he was the
chief of the German spy system in America—an example
of all that a nobleman should not be.</p>

<p>It was shown by Mr. Bielaski that the German consul in
Chicago, Reiswitz, suggested as long ago as 1915 that German
interests ought to buy the Wright aeroplane factories
in Dayton, Ohio, in an attempt to stop the shipment
of aeroplanes to the Allies. Something stopped the shipment—let
us suppose that it was not the efficiency of Germany
so much as our own inefficiency, deplorable as that
admission must be.</p>

<p>Nothing came of this attempt, nor of the attempt to
control the Bridgeport Projectile Works, in any very conclusive
and satisfactory fashion for Germany. A year
later von Bernstorff begins to complain that German propaganda
has not been producing much result. He cuts free
from the German publication, “Fair Play,” and declares
that he would be glad to be well quit of George Sylvester
Viereck’s “Fatherland.” He asks his imperial government
to give him $50,000 more, with which he would like to
start a monthly magazine in the United States. This was
the beginning of those general revelations which exposed
alike the clumsiness of German diplomacy, and the
endeavor of German espionage as against our own.</p>

<p>Reiswitz was declared by Mr. Bielaski to have advised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
the continuance of the “American Embargo Conference,”
which was set on foot to create opposition to our shipment
of munitions to the Allies. He signified that this ought to
be used as an influence to swing German voters in presidential
elections. Mr. Bielaski brought into the record the
“Citizens’ Committee for Food Shipments,” which was
supported by Dr. Edmund von Mach of Cambridge. It had
been organized in the home of a prominent New York
citizen.</p>

<p>There was brought in the record also the name of a
newspaper correspondent—more is the pity for that—who
had letters from Count von Bernstorff and Captain von
Papen, military attache, declaring that this man was in
the service of Germany and Austria. The syndicate employing
this man, as is well known, cancelled his contract
as soon as his real character and his pro-German attitude
were revealed.</p>

<p>The record also declared that a former correspondent of
the <i>Cologne Gazette</i> in Washington, notified by the State
Department to leave this country, had been in close wireless
communication with a German paper in Rotterdam.</p>

<p>All of these revelations began to implicate certain
Americans prominent in business and in politics, so that
at once the transaction by the Senate Committee became
the biggest news of the time, one recrimination following
another and one explanation another in rapid sequence.
The Committee, none the less, ground on, and produced
original papers which proved German methods beyond a
doubt. Two code dispatches from von Bernstorff to the
Berlin Foreign Office were put into the evidence, one of
which was dated November 1, 1916, and stated: “Since
the Lusitania case, we have strictly confined ourselves to
such propaganda as cannot hurt us if it becomes known.
The sole exception is perhaps the peace propaganda, which
has cost the least amount, but which also has been the
most successful.”</p>

<p>Again von Bernstorff states that it would not seem desirable
for him to be held responsible for any articles in
the subsidized newspaper, “when, as now, we are in a
campaign of the bitterest character which is turning
largely upon foreign policy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Reiswitz of Chicago was on hand with estimates for
his excellent master at all times. In regard to the Embargo
Conference, he wrote in the first year of the war:
“It would require an estimated amount of $6,000 or $7,000.
The contemplated continuation of the enterprise would, in
accordance with my opinion, be favorable to the entire
German vote, and would facilitate influencing German
voters.” So we have at once the first indication of the
truth that the great German population of America is to
be handled for the particular purpose of advancing Germany’s
interests, not only in America but all over the
world.</p>

<p>Mr. Bielaski read into the record documents alleging
that the American Press Association was contemplated as
desirable for German control. A memorandum by Dr. Albert,
financial expert, stated that he would obtain a thirty
day option on the American Press Association for the price
of $900,000, with an additional $100,000 for news service.
The memorandum in full was introduced before the Committee.</p>

<p>Professor von Mach was stated by Mr. Bielaski to have
been active in behalf of interned prisoners, largely by way
of his press agent, whom he supplied with inspiration.
Von Mach was later brought before the Committee to explain
in person as best he might certain publications which
he had put out in other form.</p>

<p>Mr. Bielaski stated that German interests advanced to
the Bridgeport Projectile Company $3,400,000, and that
these interests got back $1,000,000 of this money by selling
a large part of the company’s product to Spain.</p>

<p>Mr. Bielaski mentioned a society known as the “American
Truth Society,” organized in 1910 and reported to
have been financed by the German government, to what
extent was undetermined. One record of a transfer of
$10,000 was shown.</p>

<p>Records which had been taken from the office of Wolf
von Igel showed that scarcely a ship sailed for a neutral
country which did not carry a German agent. There were
at least two American newspaper men who had been
bought outright by Germany. Blackmail was not above
the consideration of some of these fellow-conspirators.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
Amounts of $1,000 to $5,000 had been paid to subsidize
one paper which was dropped by the embassy. The owner
then threatened the embassy that if he did not get any
more money he might allow the paper to go into bankruptcy,
and the ensuing publicity would show the subsidy.
Dr. Albert was authorized to settle with this man to keep
him quiet—he paid something over $3,000 in this instance.
Continually there rose a loud wail from Dr. Albert and von
Bernstorff, “Stung!”</p>

<p>There were some recriminations between journals in
America as to the nature of the “news” sent in by American
foreign correspondents located in Germany. It was
sometimes offered in explanation of the pro-German attitude
of certain of these correspondents that it was natural
that a man resident in Germany should hear one side only
of the case. Others, more especially after the Senate revelations,
were disposed to think there might be other valuable
considerations moving correspondents thereto. Indeed,
names and dates and prices of perfectly good correspondents
are now on record with the Overman Committee.</p>

<p>The Bielaski testimony was strengthened by that of
Major Humes and Captain Lester of Military Intelligence.
Incidentally, the attempts of Germany to embroil us with
Mexico were shown. Very interesting testimony was
brought out from Carl Heinen, an interned German, formerly
a member of the Embassy staff, and a former consul
general at Mexico City. Major Humes of M.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;D. put in
the record the relations of Felix A. Somerfeld, an alien
enemy who was an alleged Villa agent in New York,
showing that in eight months Villa had received nearly
$400,000 worth of rifle cartridges from Somerfeld, who was
closely associated with the German agents, Carl Rintelen
and Friedrick Stallforth, a prominent German banker in
Mexico. The drafts on certain trust companies were produced
as part of the evidence.</p>

<p>Heinen’s deposition was subscribed to by F. A. Borgermeister,
Dr. Albert’s confidential secretary, before he was
interned at Fort Oglethorpe. This disclosed the disposition
of $33,770,000 that passed through German hands. This
money was obtained in loans from New York banks, or
through the American agents of banks in Germany.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>Secretary of War Baker had commanded Captain Lester
of Military Intelligence to make public some of the
secrets of this division which heretofore had been reposing
in the silence of the tomb. Captain Lester testified
to the confession of a former German officer, who admitted
having been sent here as a propagandist. This man told
the federal officials that in June, before the Archduke
Francis Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated, the German
government was plotting the war. Captain Lester
quoted this man as saying that in the middle of June,
1914, Bethmann-Holweg sent out inquiries to various scientists,
professors and other intellectual persons to learn
whether they were ready for foreign service in the event
of war. There were one hundred and thirty of these who
were told to be ready for instant call to service in North
and South America, Japan and China, as directors of propaganda.
They met in the Foreign Office in Berlin, July
10, 1914, and three weeks later sailed from Copenhagen
for New York under charge of Dr. Heinrich F. Albert.
In order not to arouse suspicion, most of them traveled
steerage.</p>

<p>Captain Lester, after a long day of testimony, referred
to the “Golden Book”—a book in which German-Americans
wrote their names after they had contributed to
a German War Relief fund. This book was to have been
presented to the Kaiserin. The purpose of this book, in
the belief of Captain Lester, was to get certain prominent
German-Americans signed up as loyal to the fatherland,
without letting them know they were doing it.</p>

<p>Captain Lester, in later testimony before the Overman
Committee, said that of the one hundred and thirty trained
and educated German propagandists sent out nearly a
month before the war started, thirty-one landed in the
United States two weeks after hostilities had started in
Europe. They became the starting point of an organization
comprising between 200,000 and 300,000 volunteers,
in large part German-Americans, who were secret spies in
this country and who reported regularly to German consuls
and agents in widely scattered centers of the German
spy system in the United States.</p>

<p>It may cause a certain horror and revulsion in the hearts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
of the American public when they realize that a quarter
of a million secret German agents were working here in
America all the time against us—just about as many as
existed of loyal Americans under the unseen banner of the
American Protective League. The American public now
can begin to understand something of the bitter battle
which was fought between these two secret organizations—the
quarter million German spies who lived here, and
the quarter million loyal American citizens who made this
their home and this their country.</p>

<p>Captain Lester showed that the group sent to America
had definite instructions. One was to deal with commercial
matters, another with political, and a third leader was
to take up the South American and Mexican relations.
General headquarters in New York were at 1123 Broadway,
arrangements having been made for these quarters
in advance. The Hamburg-American Company, whose
status toward us in the war is now notorious, took charge
of the first work of the German Press Bureau. The original
artist in this labor was replaced by a newspaper man,
whose salary from Germany was later discovered to have
been $15,000. A former major of the United States, once
a newspaper man, was declared to have been hired at $40
a week to report to these German headquarters any confidential
interviews he might have with Washington officials.</p>

<p>The Lutheran church propaganda was brought definitely
before the Overman Committee. Dr. Albert and Dr. Fuhr
had this form of propaganda in charge. Captain Lester
said that there are about six thousand Lutheran congregations
in the United States, with a membership of nearly
3,000,000, and that the propaganda was directed through
pastors who had been born in Germany, or were alien
enemies, or were of German parentage. There were over
one thousand two hundred individual cases investigated.
Readers of these pages will recall a few instances of the
work of the American Protective League in looking into
these many instances of disloyalty. Captain Lester said:
“We have found in localities that the word had gone
down the line to groups of clergymen that they were to
preach sermons in favor of Germany, and that this had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
been done. I investigated a case in New York where the
clergyman admitted to me he had received instructions
to preach such a sermon. From August, 1914, to April,
1917, in hundreds of Lutheran churches, the continuous
preaching was in favor and hope of German victory.”</p>

<p>It transpired that British Military Intelligence had in
possession a great mass of documents taken by General
Allenby in the capture of Nazareth. These were found
among the effects of that Major Franz von Papen who once
had been military attache in Washington, and whose name
has become more or less familiar through some of the disclosures
regarding von Bernstorff and his activities.</p>

<p>These papers, added to those taken by our own Intelligence
officers from prominent Germans this side the water,
go to build up the tremendous and tragic story of a
nation’s shame. Germany had a widely spread and elaborate
plan to ruin this country. She failed. The proofs
of her failure are now before the public, and they run very
wide. They do not leave us feeling any too comfortable
or any too sure regarding our own country. It is not
pleasant to have listed, as part with the German records,
those of our great newspapers which, in the German belief,
might be classed as “neutral or favorable to Germany.”
It is not pleasant to see the names of newspaper men once
held honorable and loyal, but now condemned to have had
the itching palm and to have received German gold. There
is nothing pleasant about the whole sordid, abominable
story, nothing clean, nothing satisfying, nothing honorable.
But it shows that when we had this sort of work
to do, we did it thoroughly and accomplished the mission
on which our men were sent out.</p>

<p>Some of the most sensational testimony was that brought
out by Alfred L. Becker, Deputy Attorney General of New
York, who had in charge a great many of the big espionage
and treason investigations in that city, which was the
American home and headquarters of the German spy army.</p>

<p>Mr. Becker told of his own investigations, at the instance
of the French Government, in the case of Bolo Pacha.
The latter was executed as a French traitor, but was shown
to have gotten Germany money in this country to the
extent of $1,683,000. As is well known, Bolo had raised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
this money to purchase the Paris <i>Journal</i>. This paper,
however, did not change its loyalty to France, so there
was a loud wail on the part of Germany’s head spies that
they had been swindled once more.</p>

<p>Mr. Becker produced many British secret service documents
showing the elaborate governmental arrangements
in Berlin to establish and maintain spy systems, both before
and after the war. These documents listed, as agents,
journalists, college professors, bankers, business men, consular
attaches, and others of all ranks. Mr. Becker showed
that a former German reservist, later an auditor of accounts
in New York City, was told as early as 1909 that he would
be valuable in case of war as a German propagandist in
the United States. It was intended to get a good system
of distribution of German “kultur” established in America.
Then there could at once be put before American
readers such stories as that systematic attempt made in
1917 to advance the idea that Germany was on the verge
of revolt and that the Kaiser soon would be overthrown.
The German censor was back of the dissemination of these
reports, it being maintained to paralyze the prosecution
of the war in this country, where we had the pleasant
theory that the German Kaiser and the German people
were not at one as to the war.</p>

<p>Mr. Becker also went into many transactions of Ambassador
von Bernstorff, showing him to have been quite
willing to buy the Paris <i>Journal</i> with German money if
need be. He placed in the record correspondence which
showed that when Dr. Dernburg left Germany for the
United States in August, 1914, the German government
deposited 25,000,000 marks with M. M. Warburg &amp; Company
of Hamburg, which Mr. Becker stated was for propaganda
purposes in the United States. Dr. Dernburg
brought to this country a power of attorney from the
Imperial Secretary of the Treasury, which gave him the
distribution of the fund. Of this fund, $400,000 was turned
over to Dr. Albert, head of German finances in New York,
by Dr. Dernburg.</p>

<p>Mr. Becker gave a long list of banks which had participated
in the sale of German bonds in this country, these
banks being located in the principal cities of the east and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
west. He named as well the chain of banks in which the
German government opened accounts for certain purposes.
He showed the credentials brought from the German chancellor
by Dr. Dernburg to large financial institutions in
New York, which were made repositories of German funds.
The letter to one such banking firm in New York, from
Warburg &amp; Company of Hamburg, establishing the German
credit of 25,000,000 marks, was made a part of the
record, also the power of attorney enclosed by Dr. Dernburg
to the New York repository.</p>

<p>Mr. Becker mentioned the underwriting of German
bonds by a New York concern to a total amount of $9,908,000.
The proceeds were deposited with a trust company
in New York to the order of the Imperial German Government,
and were checked out by von Bernstorff and Albert
for deposit in the chain of banks above referred to. It
was the intention to make these banking institutions favorable
to the German ideas, and unfavorable to the American
bond sales. An initial deposit was made with the Equitable
Trust Company of $3,350,000; the Columbia Trust
Company had an initial deposit of $750,000; the Chase
National Bank was alleged to have had an initial deposit
of $125,000. As the proceeds of the German war loan
notes accumulated, the deposits in certain of these New
York financial institutions were increased. In order to
avoid any legal complications, the German government
opened a blind account so that Dr. Albert could go on
with his operations without any fear of detection by anyone
desiring to bring legal action against him. These
figures will give the reader some idea of the extent of
the German finances. <i>All this money—and many times the
amounts above mentioned—was spent for the one and only
purpose of German propaganda and spy work in the United
States.</i></p>

<p>Major Humes took Dr. Edmund von Mach over the
jumps in his cross-examination before the Overman Committee.
Von Mach came in for a gruelling by Senator
Nelson and others of the Committee when he attempted
to speak in justification of German practices in war. He
did his best to carry water on both shoulders, but had a
very unhappy quarter of an hour. He was followed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
preceded on the stand by certain literary gentlemen, college
professors and others, who undertook to explain to
the Committee utterances they had made in print or elsewhere
which were charged to show disloyalty to the interests
of the United States. It is impossible to give in any
sort of detail the vast extension of the testimony before
this Committee, or to mention the many widely extended
forms of the German activities that ran in this country
during the war. Perhaps we may summarize the German
attitude, as well as in any other way, by citing the opinion
of that delectable gentleman, the Count von Bernstorff,
ambassador of the Imperial German Government at Washington,
in his communication to the Foreign Office in Berlin,
in explanation of his activities in the United States:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is particularly difficult in a hostile country to find suitable
persons for help of this sort, and to this fact, as well as
the Lusitania case, we may attribute the shipwreck of the
German propaganda initiated by Herr Dernburg. Now that
opinion is somewhat improved in our favor, and that we are
no longer ostracized, we can take the work up again. As I
have said before, our success depends entirely upon finding
the suitable people. We can then leave to them whether they
will start a daily, weekly, or a monthly, and the sort of support
to be given. In my opinion, we should always observe
the principle that either a representative of ours should buy
the paper, or that the proprietor should be secured by us by
continuous support. The latter course has been followed by
the English in respect of the New York ——, and our
enemies have spent here large sums in this manner. All the
same, I do not think that they pay regular subsidies. At
least, I never heard of such. This form of payment is moreover
inadvisable, because one can never get free of the
recipients. They all wish to become permanent pensioners of
the Empire, and if they fail in that, they try to blackmail us.</p>

<p>I, therefore, request your Excellency to sanction the payment
in question.</p>
</div>

<p>By way of general summary, it may be said that a well-defined
organization long existed in our country, districted
with the usual German exactness. German Naval Intelligence
had charge of destruction of our shipping, naval
sabotage, etc. Boy-Ed, naval attache at Washington, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
to have handled this. The notorious Rintelen, who seemed
to have operated independently in New York, confined his
activities rather to the making of bombs to be concealed
on ships, to the incitement of strikes, munition embargoes,
etc. Dr. Scheele, one of the three most prominent spies
in America, was relied on to devise means of burning
ships at sea. His method of bomb manufacture is spoken
of later.</p>

<p>What is equivalent to our Military Intelligence Department
in Germany, in turn took up the question of sabotage
in our ammunition works, and of getting contraband stuff
into Germany. Scheele, who was taken in custody by the
United States, declared that this country was divided into
military districts, and that supplies of arms and ammunition
were gotten together. He even declared at one time
that he knew of 200,000 Mauser rifles stored in a German
club in New York City. He was taken there by Government
officials and located the place where the rifles probably
had been stored, although they had in the meantime
been removed.</p>

<p>Von Papen, military attache at Washington, had much
the same work for the army that Boy-Ed had taken on
for the navy. He often appears in the revelations of the
German spy system, as in the plot against the Welland
Canal, and the Vanceboro bridge, for which Werner Horn
was arrested. Von Papen had the charge of the Bridgeport
Projectile Company, which was intended to disorganize
our manufacture of munitions. He had some sort
of charge of Scheele, the German chemist spy, who is, perhaps,
the best known example now remaining on American
soil of the German espionage system.</p>

<p>Special commissions to spread disease germs were sent
to this country, as perhaps A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. reading will have indicated.
A good deal of this work failed because so many
of the German spies were interned early in the war, and
there has been no good opportunity since to replace these
men properly, the war having traveled too fast when once
America was in it.</p>

<p>But what, perhaps, has shocked and horrified Americans
more than anything else (and it cannot be too often iterated)
was the knowledge that long before this war Germany<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
had a vast system of spies all through America. This
system of international spies was originated almost a generation
ago by the Prussian War Office. There were supposed
to have been about 30,000 spies in France before
this war was declared. England also was well sown with
such persons in every rank of life. We had our share.</p>

<p>Dr. Scheele told the Department of Justice when he was
taken in charge that for twenty-one years before the outbreak
of the European war he had been stationed in Brooklyn
as a representative of the German government. His
“honorarium,” as he called it, was $125 a month. He
had been a German major, yet owned a drug store in
Brooklyn. A couple of months before war was declared
by Germany, he was told to get rid of his drug store—that
is to say, to mobilize in America for the German
purposes in the coming war. He said the drug store was
doing very well. Others of these fixed spies got salaries
about like that of Scheele, a retainer of $1,000 nominal
salary being more frequent. In charge of all these lesser
regular spies, who had been absorbed in the American
citizenship, were the consuls and the high diplomatic officials
of the Imperial German Government in our country.
It would be a very great deal to hope that this system has
been actually extirpated. That it did exist is true without
any doubt or question.</p>

<p>Any A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. man whose work was identified with the
larger eastern cities will note many points of contact of
the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. with D.&nbsp;J. and M.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;D. in the testimony
brought before the Overman Committee. It is, of course,
not too much to say that A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. was at the foundation
of much of that testimony itself. Many of the facts above
brought out are of record in the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. files.</p>

<p>In yet another line of Government work, the League has
been very useful—that of coöperating with Mr. A. Mitchell
Palmer, Custodian of Alien Property, whose statements,
made elsewhere than in the committee, constitute a
rather valuable extension of the committee’s information.</p>

<p>Reference was made before the committee to the Bridgeport
Projectile Company. Mr. Palmer some time ago
announced that he had taken over 19,900 of the 20,000
shares of the capital stock of that concern, and that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
had been reported to him other property of approximate
value of $500,000 held by it for and in behalf of Germany.</p>

<p>In a statement accredited to him, Mr. Palmer again
bared the efforts of that malodorous quartet, Count von
Bernstorff, Dr. Albert, Dr. Dernburg and Captain von
Papen. It was the obvious intent of these to use the
Bridgeport Projectile Company to prevent the manufacture
and shipment of arms and ammunition to the Allies.
The taking over of the stock of the Bridgeport Projectile
Company, and the report by the company of the property
owned by the German government, with the disclosures
incident thereto, followed many months of persistent
investigation.</p>

<p>It was planned to have this corporation buy up all the
available supplies of powder, antimony, hydraulic presses,
and other supplies and materials essential to the manufacture
of munitions. The plan also involved the negotiation
of contracts with the allied Governments to supply
them with materials of war, apparently in good faith but
in reality with no intention of fulfilling them. The ultimate
expenditure of approximately $10,000,000 for this
purpose was contemplated.</p>

<p>In a cable from London printed in the American press
on the morning of January 15, 1919, a statement was given
from a German newspaper quoting Dr. Dernburg, the German
propagandist who was expelled from America some
years ago. Now Dr. Dernburg comes out in the Vienna
<i>Neue Freie Presse</i> and states that Germany is depending
upon “a certain drawing together of Germany and the
United States.” He believes that nothing should be done
which will “give foundation for a lasting alienation of
the two peoples.” He finds the Allies in victory somewhat
difficult in their terms, so that Germans turn their eyes
and expectations toward America, “and feel sure that
their expectations will not come to grief.” He goes on
to say that Germany needs raw materials for the revival
of her industries, needs credit, and also a market. He
looks to America for all these, and says: “A fear of
German competition does not exist in America in the
same degree as in France and England. The hatred against
the German people does not exist since the dynasty has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
been overthrown, and it is quite possible that America
will transfer English and French debts to Germany in
order to give her money, for America seeks not destruction
but justice. Our two countries will be brought
together, and as rivalry is out of the question, this coöperation
will take a more tolerable form than in the case of
our neighbors.” He goes on to say: “A careful economic
policy, I think, will secure Germans sympathy,
thereby providing economic help for our German industries,
now in collapse, and possibly awaken stirring echoes
in two million Americans of German origin.... America
will have other interests in Germany allied with her
by interest and by service rendered to Germany; so taking
all these points of view together, one may well consider
that the earliest possible reconciliation between Germany
and America will be good for the future of the world and
will be welcomed by the German people.”</p>

<p>The human mind with difficulty can conceive of anything
indicative of more brazen effrontery than the foregoing.
That is the statement to-day of one of the arch-traitors
planted in this country by Germany. No doubt,
it may awaken a “stirring echo” at least in the hearts
of the quarter million of German spies who worked with
Dernburg here.</p>

<p>The great danger to America is her unsuspiciousness.
Having lived half a century cheek by jowl with these
men, although in ignorance of their real quality, we are
expected to go on living with them on the same terms
that existed before the war. Great Britain, sterner than
we, definitely has announced her intention of deporting
German aliens—she intends to take no chances. What
the French will do is a foregone conclusion. German “kultur”
is begging at the doorsteps of the world.</p>

<p>Mr. Palmer, custodian of alien enemy property, can
complete the story. For instance, there was loose talk
around New York in the early days of the war that under
one tennis court in New Jersey there was a gun emplacement
from which New York could be bombarded. It was
said that a German-owned factory building had a gun
emplacement built into its floor with the same amiable
intention. Custodian Palmer points out that there really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
was a concrete pier in the port of St. Thomas, Virgin
Islands, with a concealed base suitable for heavy gun
mounts. That pier now belongs to the United States Government.
Before the war it was the property of a steamship
company organized by wealthy Germans, of whom
Emperor William was one. Its office was in the headquarters
of the German spies in New York. After the United
States went to war, the pier was sold to a Dane to cover
the ownership. The Dane could not meet his note when
it came due, and Mr. Palmer confiscated the pier immediately
as German property.</p>

<p>Mr. Palmer stated, long before the Overman Committee
began its testimony, that Germany, years before she started
this war, had undertaken to plant on American soil a
great industrial and commercial army. She believed she
could keep America out of the conflict, for she had her
organization in every state of the Union. It reached across
the Pacific to Hawaii and the Philippines and up to Alaska;
in the Atlantic it was found in Porto Rico, the Virgin Islands
and Panama. Industry after industry was built up, totaling
probably two billion dollars in money value, and billions
more in potential political value.</p>

<p>“Germany had spies in the German-owned industries
of Pittsburgh, Chicago, New York and the West,” says
Mr. Palmer. “She fought the war when we were neutral
on American soil by agents sent here for that purpose.”</p>

<p>St. Andrew’s Bay, not far from Pensacola, Florida, is
a very fine harbor, the nearest American harbor, indeed,
to the Panama canal. Mr. Palmer shows that this was
wholly controlled by Germans, who were organized in the
form of a lumber company and who had purchased thousands
of acres of timber nearby. The wealthy owner of
the German property never saw it. A concealed fort had
been constructed there, and right of way on the shore had
been purchased. Not even the Government of the United
States could have obtained a terminal on St. Andrew’s Bay
unless it did business with the owner in Berlin. Such
being the case, Custodian Palmer did not buy it at all—he
simply took it in and added it to his list of more than
two billion dollars’ worth of German-owned property taken
over since the war began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>There were German spies in our chemical works, metal
industries, textile concerns, and in every line of our commerce.
They had a fund, mentioned at different times in
the Overman Committee testimony, which was somewhere
between thirty millions and sixty millions of dollars—all
of it to be used in propaganda, subsidizing, subornation
and destruction.</p>

<p>There were three or four German firms in America which
had much to do with the German declaration of war.
They were instrumental in piling up the gigantic quantities
of American metals, to prepare that country for its
onslaught in 1914. There were great stocks of copper
accumulated in America to be sold to Germany after the
close of the war. The actual ownership of these things
was so very carefully concealed by a masquerading interchangeable
personnel that it required months of investigation
to get at the real facts and to discover that the
real owner was Germany itself. In taking over these metal
businesses, Alien Property Custodian Palmer broke the German
control of the metal industry of America. It has
been intended to wipe out these industries so completely
that they cannot get a start again.</p>

<p>The New York <i>Times</i> of November 3, 1918, printed a
quarter-page story in regard to some of these revelations
which should be made not only a part of the record of the
Senate Committee but of the records of America itself:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When on April 6, 1917, America declared war on Germany,
there was in New York as American representative of the
Deutsche Bank of Berlin, a German by the name of Hugo
Schmidt. As the world now knows, it was the Deutsche Bank
which financed the von Bernstorff-Bolo Pacha plot to debauch
France, which formulated a scheme to corner the wool market
of the world, a plot the object of which was to gain control
of the after-the-war trade in South America, and which,
through its agents in this country and South America, was
keeping tab on the political situation in this hemisphere for
the Foreign Office in Berlin. How these plots and numerous
others were planned and how they were to be carried out,
was disclosed in a great mass of documents which will go
down in history as the “Hugo Schmidt Papers.”</p>

<p>Despite the fact that he was one of the first of the Kaiser’s
subjects to be arrested after this country entered the war, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
despite the fact that he knew the all-important nature of the
papers, Schmidt failed to destroy the documents. He acted on
the theory that the United States Government would not take
them, and so he catalogued them and stored them away in his
private office at Broadway and Rector Street, and in his living
quarters in the old German Club in West Fifty-ninth Street.</p>

<p>It was the plotting of Bernstorff and Bolo Pacha, with
Adolph Pavenstedt, the enemy alien banker of New York,
acting as a go-between, that caused the seizure of Schmidt’s
papers, with the unmasking of scores of German political and
trade plots, involving financial backing mounting into the
hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

<p>The revelations which have followed the seizure of these
papers have filled pages in the newspapers of the United
States and the rest of the world, and yet the story has not
yet been half told. The new chapters in a story, which has
been pronounced by Federal officials among the most interesting
of all the disclosures brought about as a result of the
great war, will be issued by Deputy Attorney General Alfred
L. Becker, the man who exposed Bolo.</p>

<p>The seizure of millions of dollars worth of German-owned
property in this country has been made possible, to a large
extent, by Mr. Becker’s seizure of Schmidt’s papers. But for
its conclusive evidence of the true ownership of certain great
properties, the Government of the United States would have
had an almost impossible job in ferreting out the trade footholds
of the Hun in America. To-day the Government is in
control of great woolen mills, of huge plants now engaged in
the manufacture of munitions of war, of splendid ocean-going
steamships (not those of the Hamburg-American and North
German Lloyd lines), which, until Schmidt’s papers were
studied, were supposed to be neutral or American owned;
not to mention numerous other important plants, all of which
were proved to be of enemy ownership and of which a majority
have already been auctioned off to bona fide American ownership
and control.</p>

<p>Aside from what the future may disclose as a result of a
further study and investigation of Schmidt’s papers, the following
summary, prepared in the office of Mr. Becker, shows
in a condensed form the results obtained to date as a result
of the seizure of the German banker’s books and other data:</p>

<p>1. Part of documents that helped in the conviction of Bolo
Pacha.</p>

<p>2. Furnished evidence upon which Hugo Schmidt and
Adolph Pavenstedt were interned.</p>

<p>3. Furnished evidence disclosing German plot to hoard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
wools and other textiles for German account; furnished evidence
enabling the Government to take control of Forstmann
&amp; Huffmann Company, and proving conclusively the German
ownership of the Botany Worsted Mills.</p>

<p>4. Furnished evidence upon which Eugene Schwerdt was
interned.</p>

<p>5. Furnished key of the secret telegraphic code of the
Deutsche Bank, which since has been used by all the intelligence
bureaus throughout the world to decode wireless and
cable messages as well as correspondence.</p>

<p>6. Furnished information to compile an index showing
approximately 32,000 subscribers in America for war loans
of the Central Powers.</p>

<p>7. Disclosed payments of moneys made by the German
Foreign Office to their diplomatic representatives abroad,
notably to the German Minister in Buenos Aires, about
8,000,000 marks ($1,600,000); to the German Minister in
Mexico, about $178,000; to the Minister at Port-au-Prince,
Haiti, $120,000, etc.</p>

<p>8. Disclosed the payments made by the German Foreign
Office, through the Deutsche Bank, to its diplomatic representatives
in the United States, von Bernstorff, Boy-Ed, von
Papen and Albert, to carry on different methods of German
propaganda and frightfulness, as well as commercial aggression.</p>

<p>9. Disclosed extensive plans for the control of South American
trade by German interests, and showed German methods
of keeping a close scrutiny on the political situation of the
several South American republics.</p>

<p>10. Disclosed means adopted for carrying on German business
in enemy as well as in neutral countries, and gave to the
authorities the names of the German agents in every neutral
country in the world.</p>

<p>The arrest and internment of Schmidt and Pavenstedt was a
direct result of the exposure of Bolo Pacha. Pavenstedt is the
former head of the banking house of G. Amsinck &amp; Co., and for
years was among the best known of the Kaiser’s subjects in
New York. The Schmidt papers disclosed him as an intimate
of von Bernstorff, Dr. Albert, Boy-Ed, and von Papen, and as
the man to whom Bolo went immediately on arrival in
this country in the late winter of 1916. Pavenstedt negotiated
for Bernstorff the financial part of the conspiracy which resulted
in the payment to Bolo out of the funds of the Deutsche
Bank in this country a sum totaling about $1,700,000.</p>

<p>It was also disclosed that immediately following the outbreak
of the war, Boy-Ed and von Papen hurried to New York
to establish propaganda and plot headquarters as per instructions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
received from Berlin. Boy-Ed, like Bolo, first sought
Pavenstedt, who found room for the German naval attache in
his own office in the bank building. Later, when the newspapers
began to print stories of the questionable operations of
the German naval and military attaches, they moved to other
headquarters, the transfer being made “for reasons of policy,”
at the suggestion of Pavenstedt.</p>

<p>The story of Bolo is known to every one, and it is not necessary
to point out how the Schmidt papers led to that traitor’s
arrest and subsequently to his execution by a French firing
squad.</p>
</div>

<p>Here is an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. case which is recommended to the
attention of those who write short stories of a detective
nature: It has to do with a beautiful adventuress, who
among other things was known as a countess. Let us not
give the real name. We will call her Mrs. Jeannette
Sickles, alias Countess De Galli, alias Mrs. Dalbert, alias
Rose La Foine, alias Jeannette McDaniels, alias Miss Ellen
Hyde, alias Jeannette La Foine—we need not give more
of her names. The records of this case show that she was
entangled with an employe of the Adjutant General’s office,
a night clerk, whose duties were to sort the mail. This
clerk under examination admitted that he knew this lady,
admitted that he had become very fond of her—was,
indeed, in love with her; said she had kissed him and
given him divers manifestations of her affection; said he
had met her often at hotels in the presence of others; said
she came to him for advice about certain unfair treatment
which she thought the Department of Justice had given
her; said he was going to marry the lady if he had a
chance, as he had found her a very congenial woman. The
writer of fiction can easily fill out the details. The adventuress
was intelligent, beautiful and accomplished. She
was working close to many of our Government secrets; it
would be her fault if she did not learn a great many
things about this country and its government.</p>

<p>It was stated that this particular Government clerk was
known to be a socialist; was corresponding with Emma
Goldman. Other charges were made against him, not
redounding to the credit of his moral character. He was
rated as being a man slovenly in his looks and “with no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
moral and mental stamina.” In short, the field was pretty
good for the purposes of German espionage. Pages could
be written covering the activities of this particular emissary.
She was one of a certain type who will work anywhere
for money. During the Red Cross drives in Washington,
she was suspected by some of the operatives who
were working for the United States Shipping Board. It
was discovered that she was working in that department,
also, as a welfare worker “under very mysterious circumstances.”
She was cared for.</p>

<p>There was a certain gentleman by the name of Dr.
Frederick August von Strensch, who was arrested by the
Department of Justice on testimony furnished by operatives.
The worthy doctor might have been regarded as
practically innocent—all he planned was the invasion of
Canada and Mexico by German reservists located in the
United States. This man had long made America his home.
He was arrested on a presidential warrant. Along with
him, there was arrested a certain dazzling stage celebrity
represented to have been a countess in her more private
life in Europe. A mass of correspondence was taken with
these people, revealing the fact that 150,000 German reservists
were to be sent to Canada, about the same number
into Mexico. Definite plans were mentioned referring to
the assemblage of 25,000 men on the Canadian border.
This one plot alone, if mentioned here in detail, would
give all the data necessary for a sensational thriller in
detective fiction. But it is not fiction. This sort of work
actually went on within our country. Not only in this
instance, but in many others, a deliberate and extremely
dangerous attempt was made to embroil us with other
countries.</p>

<p>When the merchant submarine “Deutschland” arrived
in this country on its celebrated voyage, a part of its
cargo consisted of thirty-three thousand pounds of tungsten,
scarce in this country, but of value in making certain
high grades of steel. After considerable sleuthing on the
part of operatives, this tungsten was traced to a concern
ostensibly American, but really owned altogether by Germans.
The way in which the identity of these steel manufacturers
was concealed is proof of the ingenuity and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
resourcefulness of the master criminal minds of the world.
As showing the thoroughness with which Germany works,
one of the accused stated that when he came out of Germany
to confer with his associates, the German censors
destroyed all his papers, examined all his clothing, and
stripped him and washed him with a solution of alcohol
to eradicate any message which he might have painted on
his skin! They were not above a suspicion on their own
part. The Alien Property Custodian took over, as a result
of these investigations, the Becker Steel Company, whose
plant was located at Charleston, W. Va. The details of
this case are extremely voluminous.</p>

<p>The passport frauds have long been “old stuff” in the
American journals, and need be no more than referred to
here. At the time German reservists were needed in the
Old Country (there were more than a thousand very useful
officers here who were much needed in the German army),
the question of passports came up. These men could not
get <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> passports, so a general system of forged passports
was set on foot in which the highest diplomatic officials
of Germany in America did not scorn to take a hand.
It was their idea of honorable service, one supposes. Certainly,
von Bernstorff—whom we kept in this country
long after he should have been kicked out—employed a
go-between who arranged and carried on a very considerable
traffic in foreign passports. The ordinary price was
about twenty dollars,—small business, truly, for an ambassador,
but von Bernstorff, von Papen, von Weddell, von
Igel and others worked together in this thing until the
Department of Justice men got too hot upon their trail.
A long and intricate story hangs upon this. It is enough
to say that the frauds were unearthed and the lower and
middle class operatives in the frauds were put away. Von
Weddell, the most important of these conspirators, took
ship for Norway. However, the ship on which he sailed
was sunk by a German U-boat,—tragic justice in at least
one instance.</p>

<p>Another of the well known German enterprises against
England and her Indian empire was brought to light in
the so-called Hindu Plot—also very well known through
newspaper publication. It came to a focus in a trial in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
San Francisco, in which one Hindu leader shot another
and was himself shot the next instant in the court room
by a deputy marshal in attendance—a fact which perhaps
lingers in the public memory even in these exciting days.
The Hindu plot, reduced to its simple and banal lowest
common denominator, consisted in a more or less useless
intrigue with certain more or less uninfluential citizens
of Hindu birth. One phase of the activities was the purchase
with German money in New York of several hundred
thousand rifles and several million cartridges, which were
to be shipped in a vessel from the Pacific Coast to meet a
certain other vessel far out in the Pacific for transfer of
the cargo. That cargo was to be delivered where it would
do the most good to any Hindu gentleman disposed to
rise against the British authority. It is a long and rather
dull story—how everything miscarried for our friends
the Germans and the Hindus. The rifles never were delivered;
the conspirators were brought to trial; the conspiracy
was ended. And at the end, in a court room, and because
he himself had a weapon in his hand, we got one Hindu
Hun at least.</p>

<p>As a mere trifle, it may be mentioned that Joseph
W——, an Austrian subject, was arraigned in the Enemy
Alien Bureau at New York, charged with having in his
possession a United States navy code book. <span class="nowrap">W——</span> was
said to be a “collector of stamps.” He had in his possession
a map of South America, and a list of warships
of the Brazilian navy. He had also certain sheets of paper
carrying mysterious characters made up of letters and
dashes. He said he had been a piano player and was taking
music lessons by mail.</p>

<p>Lt. Christian <span class="nowrap">S——</span> was before the Enemy Alien
Bureau at the same time. He was once six years in the
German army as an officer of the Uhlans. One day <span class="nowrap">S——</span>
called on United States Marshal McCarthy and asked him
to help him get a job. He returned to find out if the
marshal had found a place for him, and when the marshal
said he had not, the German showed anger and remarked:
“This is what makes us disloyal!” Marshal McCarthy
arrested <span class="nowrap">S——</span> and arraigned him before Perry Armstrong,
assistant chief of the Enemy Alien Bureau. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
answer to questions, <span class="nowrap">S——</span> said he did not approve of
German-Americans, that he approved of the sinking of
the Lusitania and endorsed what the Germans had done
in Belgium. He was committed to Ludlow Street jail
pending further investigation.</p>

<p>Last May there was arrested in New York one Gustave
B. <span class="nowrap">K——</span>, of whom it was said: “Not only is he an
officer of the German army and an intimate friend and
adviser of von Bernstorff, von Papen, and Boy-Ed, but
he is also a confidant, it is said, of the Kaiser and the
Crown Prince. Though he has lived in the United States
twenty years, he is still a German subject and is said to
have paid out large sums of German money on Boy-Ed’s
account, having had as much as $750,000 for that purpose
in one New York bank at one time.”</p>

<p>It is enough! Further details would be revolting.
Enough has been shown to develop some idea of the tremendous
centralization of these international spy activities
on the eastern seaboard of America. It was with these
that the cities of New York and Washington had the most
to do.</p>

THE SPY HIMSELF</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Perverted German Mind—Stories of Brutal Indifference
to Innocent Victims—Treason, Treachery, and Unmorality
Hand in Hand—The Authentic Story of Dr.
Scheele—Twenty-one Years a German Spy in America—The
“Honor of a German Officer.”</p>
</div>

<p>Comment has been made elsewhere in these pages on
the curiously perverted nature of the German intellect.
It would not be truthful to call all Germans unintellectual
or unscientific, for the reverse of this is in part true. But
continually in its most elaborate workings, the German
mind displays reversions to grossness, coarseness, and
bestiality. Perversions and atrocities seem natural to their
soldiers. These restrictions apply often to men in high
authority. The German officer was perhaps even more a
brute than the German private.</p>

<p>Take the case of the man Thierichens, Captain of the
<i>Prinz Eitel Friedrich</i>, which was interned at Norfolk in
March, 1915, after a successful career of six months as
a commerce raider. For a long time Captain Thierichens
was hailed in this country as a sort of naval hero; he
received the admiration not only of men but of women.
It was only after a considerable career in adulation that
the tide of public estimation turned in regard to this
man. His private correspondence was investigated, and
it was found that he was carrying on correspondence with
women in this country which showed a depth of human
depravity on his part which cannot be understood and
may not be described.</p>

<p>This phase of German mentality was manifested also
in the highest diplomatic representatives that that country
sent abroad. These men had no sense of honor or morality,
but curiously enough, they were not aware of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
own lack. They performed the most pernicious acts of
treason, and yet were never conscious they were committing
any crime. Von Bernstorff, Dumba, von Papen,
Boy-Ed, Bolo Pacha, Rintelen and Dr. Scheele—such a
record of treachery never has been known in all the history
of diplomacy; such a wholly devilish ingenuity, such
an intellectual finesse in conspiracy, such a delicate exactness
and such a crude brutality in destruction, never have
been manifested on the part of any other nation in the
world. The flower of centuries of civilization in Germany’s
case had been merely a baneful, noisome bloom,
and not the sweet product of an actual culture. The efflorescence
of the German heart is the fungus of decay. Feed
them? Why should we feed them? Trust them? Why
should we trust them? Spare them? Why should we
spare them? Receive them? Why should we receive
them? Believe them? Why should we ever believe them?</p>

<p>A fine band of conspirators was uncovered by investigations
of attempted atrocities against our eastern shipping.
There was a man named Robert Fay who had invented a
ship bomb, and who had all the German money he needed
back of him. His machine was a sort of tank which he
fastened to the rudder post just below the water line of
a ship which was being loaded and which stood high in
the water. As the vessel was loaded, it would submerge
the tank and leave everything out of sight under water.
Fay had worked out one of the most ingenious devices
which any of the investigating Government engineers had
ever seen.</p>

<p>His scheme, as Mr. Strothers describes it in his book,
“Fighting Germany’s Spies,” was to go under the stern
of an ocean steamer in a small boat and to affix to the
rudder post this little tank. Of course every reader will
know that in steering a ship the rudder turns first this
way, then that. Fay had a rod so adjusted that every
time the rudder moved it turned a beveled wheel within
the bomb just one notch. A certain number of revolutions
of that wheel—which of course would be very slow and
gradual—would turn the next wheel of the clock one
notch. This would gear into the wheel next beyond it.
The last wheel would slowly unscrew a threaded cap at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
the head of a bolt which had, pressing upon its top, a
strong spring. When the cap was loose the bolt would
drop and it would act like a firing pin in a rifle, its point
striking upon the cap of a rifle cartridge which was
adjusted just above a small charge of chloride of potash.
Below the potash there was a charge of dynamite, and
below that again a charge of the tremendous explosive
trinitrotoluol—the explosive known as “T.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;T.”</p>

<p>Suppose the device adjusted to the rudder of a steamship
on some dark night in New York harbor. The cargo
is loaded on the ship; inch by inch the ship sinks down,
and this contrivance, spiked on the rudder post, is lost
to sight. The ship steams out to sea. Every time she
swings to change her course, every time the rudder is
adjusted gently, a notch in the leisurely clock trained
below her stern slips with a little, unheard click. Far out
at sea—for what reason no one can tell—without any
warning, the whole stern of the ship heaves up in the air.
The water rushes in; the boilers explode. The ship, her
cargo, her crew, her passengers, are gone.</p>

<p>Well, it cost but little. A few dollars would make such
a bomb. Von Papen looked it over. He did not object
to the cost; indeed, Germany did not scruple to spend
any sum of money of the millions she sent to America,
provided it would produce results. But von Papen was
not sure of this; he did not think much of it. He declined
it. As to the immorality of it, the frightfulness of it—that
never came into his mind at all.</p>

<p>One recalls reading the other day that Great Britain
had shot only fourteen spies. We did not shoot one in
America.</p>

<p>The Federal grand jury in New York on December 6,
1918, returned indictments charging treason against two
men who already were in the Tombs awaiting trial on an
earlier charge of conspiracy. This was the first actual treason
trial since we entered the war. The men were Paul
Fricke of Mt. Vernon and Hermann Wessells, an Imperial
German Government spy, former officer of the German
navy, then domiciled in America. Their co-defendants in
the conspiracy trial were Jeremiah A. O’Leary, the Sinn
Fein agitator; John T. Ryan, a Buffalo lawyer; Mme. Victorica,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
also an alleged German spy; Willard J. Robinson,
an American, and the late Dr. Hugo Schweitzer, one of
the best known German business men in New York.</p>

<p>It was alleged that the activities of Wessells had to do
with “ways and means of secretly placing explosives, or
securing other persons secretly to place explosives, on
wharves located in the United States, on ships and vessels
in ports of the United States, and plying between ports
of the United States and other countries; to blow up,
injure, and destroy the same, and cause fires thereon, and
thereby hinder and hamper the prosecution of the war
by the United States against Germany.”</p>

<p>The final overt act charged was that in July, 1917, Wessells
requested “information as to ways and means of
importing toy blocks from Switzerland,” his purpose being
to find “ways and means of secretly and clandestinely
introducing into the United States explosives and ingredients
of explosives concealed in toy blocks.”</p>

<p>Had any of these toy blocks come into the hands of
innocent children, what matter to a mind which would
regard the Lusitania sinking as justifiable war? What
difference would it make to a man hiding T.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;T. in a
child’s toys whether he killed babies in Flanders or on
the high seas or in American homes? Such men are
unmoral. One would call treason one of their lesser
crimes.</p>

<p>There was in New York City a certain German whom
we will call von <span class="nowrap">S——</span>. He was an inventor of a machine
called an aeromobile, which, however, he said he would
not sell to any government but that of Germany. He was
arrested by agents of the Department of Justice, charged
with uttering disloyal, scurrilous and profane remarks
against the Government and military forces of the United
States. He is a German-born citizen of the United States.
Enter now another citizen of the United States who spoke
as good German as von <span class="nowrap">S——</span> did and who posed as
“an official representative of the German Imperial Government
in the United States.” This latter gentleman
said he wanted to buy the <span class="nowrap">S——</span> invention for the Fatherland.
S—— turned himself inside out, saying among
other things: “Everything is fair in war—gas, poison,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
the bomb, the knife—we must stop at nothing. Germany
must triumph over her enemies. I would not hesitate to
destroy a whole city for the good of the German cause.”
After <span class="nowrap">S——</span> had been allowed to talk sufficiently, his
new friend, who proved to be an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operative in disguise,
caused his arrest by an agent in the Military Intelligence
Division. <span class="nowrap">S——</span> was struck speechless when he
found he had been trapped. He was held in ten thousand
dollars bail at the examination and committed to the
Tombs in default of surety. Would he have been admitted
to any bail at all in Germany in similar circumstances?</p>

<p>Out in a great city on Puget Sound, the Minute Men
Division of the American Protective League, after an
exhaustive investigation covering several months, arrested
a certain man whom we will call Johnson. He was charged
with conspiracy to doctor steel and iron in the Seattle
ship-yards with a powerful chemical, intending to commit
wholesale murder by wrecking troop trains. He was a
pattern-maker employed in a ship-building plant when the
Federal officials arrested him as an alleged German spy.
At the time of his arrest, he had in his pocket a bottle
containing a violent explosive. His scheme was to apply
a strong acid to steel and iron in the shipyards, which
would destroy these metals by eating them away. He
planned to place acid on iron about to be melted, so that
the resulting steel products would be valueless and the
ship-building program delayed. He was charged with
undertaking to damage the more delicate bearings of the
ships, so that they would be useless after putting out to
sea. It was part of his scheme, as developed by the operatives,
to place acids in the journal boxes of cars, with the
intent of destroying them while they were under way.
The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operatives claimed to be conspirators with
him. When one of them pointed out that such a wreck
would cost a large amount of life, the accused is said to
have replied: “Well, what’s the odds how we kill them,
and what’s the difference whether we kill them over here
or over there?” That man, like many now behind bars,
had no moral sense at all.</p>

<p>Not all of these agents of Germany were men of the
mental shrewdness of their great spy leaders. Johnson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
picked out a fellow worker and felt him out for a long
period of time as to whether he would be safe as a confidant.
This particular fellow happened to look like a
German, and to talk like one. He also happened to be an
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operative. The accused, who is charged under
the Espionage Act, does not yet know the identity of the
man who informed against him.</p>

<p>“There was one old German in my district,” says the
report of a New York state chief, “who had spent thirty
years in our region, surveying. He had been an officer
in the Franco-German war, and was a recognized expert
in real estate values, appraisals, etc. When we went into
the war, he made public a little statement telling of his
German origin and of his American citizenship. He came
under the suspicion of some, and I looked into the matter.
One of his men remembered hearing the German say,
twenty years ago, when under the influence of liquor,
that he had been a German spy in the war with France;
he also remembered the German’s story of a horse he had
used, which he had trained to run, trot or walk at certain
definite paces. By keeping track of the different gaits,
as he jogged along in his buggy over France, he would
measure certain localities and compute distances—information
which proved valuable later. It was need of such
information that made Germany send out secret surveying
forces when she was preparing to attack France. We put
this man under surveillance but could get nothing on him
except that he tried to learn when transports sailed.
Apparently he had done all his work before the war began,
just as he had in France before the other war.”</p>

<p>An ingenious and dastardly instance of spy work and
sabotage was recently uncovered in Detroit. Anton <span class="nowrap">G——</span>,
a skilled workman employed in a factory making airplane
fuel tanks, deliberately planned an aviation accident.
He took a tank which had been condemned because
the bottom sump casting had been riveted into the wrong
position, cut the rivets, properly adjusted the casting and
soldered it in place, replacing the cut rivets so that the
tank appeared O.&nbsp;K. for use. It passed the plant’s inspection,
and was installed in a plane before its dangerous
character was detected. <span class="nowrap">G——</span> has given up the making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
of airplane tanks for the duration of the war—and
longer.</p>

<p>Of all the individual spies located in America, one of
the most noted and most able was that Dr. Scheele elsewhere
mentioned as a Brooklyn druggist. Dr. Scheele
was taken in Cuba by the United States Government after
he had fled the country just ahead of the hounds. This
accomplished student and practitioner of villainy was one
of the finest chemists Germany ever produced—a descendant
of a family of chemists. He was a major in the German
army. That this man had intellect is beyond any
question—he had more than that; he had genius. He
was one of the finest examples of the great development
in Germany of commercial chemistry. Men such as he have
rendered services valuable beyond any price in almost all
ranks of commerce, and Germany’s military orders were
to get them at any price, all of them, for German-controlled
concerns. Such men have helped give Germany
her tremendous and powerful place in the commerce of
the world. This unique genius in research, this ability to
divine elemental secrets, allied with the hard working,
abstemious, thrifty, free-breeding traits of the German
people, made that nation very strong in her position among
the world forces.</p>

<p>But here again comes in the proof of the assertion made
in regard to the debased activities of the German nature,
not only in its emotional manifestations but in its intellectual
processes at well. Perhaps the one thought which
will awaken the bitterest resentment and the most long-lived
suspicion in the American mind against the German
citizen is the revelation of the fact that German spies lived
among us so long as accepted citizens, made their business
successes here, profited by our free-handed generosity,
while all the time they were agents of Germany and
traitors to the United States.</p>

<p>In the preceding chapter, reference was made to some
of these long-term spies, as they may be called—men who
were sent out on their iniquitous missions even in time of
peace. The best known of these men is Scheele, who, when
apprehended, was trying to get to Europe. Now he is
hugging the deputy <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> marshal in whose custody he is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
for fear some German will kill him for turning state’s evidence
and revealing the whole secret German spy system in
the United States. This man is the most interesting of all
the known spies.</p>

<p>In brief, Scheele came over to this country quietly, a
man quite unknown, just twenty-five years ago. For
twenty-one years, up to the outbreak of the war, he
received regularly $125 a month as his “honorarium”
from the German Government. He was one of the fixed
location spies—one of very many. He went into business,
opening a drug store in a New York suburb, and he
prospered there. He was not alone. There were many
of his people about. He met more than one prominent
German living in New York City—most of whom now
live in Fort Oglethorpe. In these influential circles, in
continuous close touch with Berlin, supplied all the time
with money from Berlin, Scheele was appraised at his true
worth as a possible agent of destruction.</p>

<p>Came to him, therefore, one day, a captain in the service
of the North German Lloyd Steamship Company. This
man carried a card. From whom? No less than von
Papen, a man accepted as bearing the credentials of a foreign
government, entitling him to courtesy in our own
country—von Papen, one of the master plotters located
on this side of the sea. Scheele was asked to invent some
sort of infernal machine by which ships could be set on
fire after they had left port and were on the high seas.
That was all. If innocent persons died, what matter? It
must be a secret sort of thing, this machine, which could
be distributed without creating a suspicion. It must be
efficient. It must be small. It must work without much
mechanism. And it must be deadly sure. This was the
sort of warfare—allied to bestiality in France and Belgium,
and red ruthlessness on the high seas—that was to
make Germany loved and revered in the whole world, as
now, amazingly enough, she asks us to be—we, her American
brothers “with whom she has no quarrel.”</p>

<p>Very well, the order was accepted by Scheele. It was
simple for this man, a mechanical and chemical genius.
Of course, he needed some materials. Where should he
get them except among fellow Germans? And were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
the entire interned crew and corps of officers of the
interned German steamships, which were lying in the Hudson,
available for his purposes? Scheele got all the lead
and tin and like material he needed there. The Scheele
cigar bomb, as it came to be called, was only three or
four inches long and an inch or two in diameter. Inside
of it was a thin partition made of tin. In a cavity at one
end was placed a certain chemical; in the other end,
divided from it for the time being by a partition sheet
of tin, was a strong corrosive acid. When the ends were
sealed the work was done.</p>

<p>It was relatively simple to put two or three of these in
a pocket and casually go aboard a ship, or through the
influence of simple and kindly German neighbor people,
have someone else go aboard the ship and drop such a
bomb into a coal bunker; or better, among the cargo. The
bomb needed absolutely no attention on the part of anyone.
Scheele, a competent, thorough, painstaking German
scientist of Germany’s highest and best type, left nothing
to chance. He experimented from time to time, and verified
his experiments. He knew how thick to make that
partition of tin. He could make it of just such a thickness
that the acid could eat through it in two or three or four
days, so that if a certain steamship carried that bomb on
the high seas for two or three or four days, in the course
of time the acid would eat through the tin. Then, in the
combination of the chemicals, heat would be generated and
a fire was absolutely certain.</p>

<p>These things sound like the invention of a diseased
mind—like the romance of some excited intellect concerning
itself with unreal and impossible events belonging
in another age—another world than ours. But they are
true, actually true. Scheele, backed by these influential
Germans in New York, backed by the diplomatic representatives
of the German Government itself—we might
as well say by all Germans also—actually did these things
in this country.</p>

<p>Not one, but many ships broke into flames in mid-Atlantic.
Sometimes the damage was not complete, but quite
frequently the loss of a merchant ship was absolute. We
cannot tell how many millions of dollars of the world’s property<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
were lost in this way through the activities of this
one perverted mind. Our censorship took care of some
of that. Those losses of foodstuffs, of fuel, of clothing,
had to be paid for by someone. They were subtracted
from the world’s useful supplies. Who paid for them?
You and I and all the taxpayers of America paid for the
losses. One does not know how much Scheele himself got
out of it—not very much; for, two months before this
war was “forced” on Germany, Scheele was ordered to
sell his drug store, and did so—though he complained he
was doing very well in it. His salary is not known to
have been raised.</p>

<p>One of the astonishing and disgusting developments of
this war had been the knowledge gained of the unspeakable
depravity and degeneracy of the German mind. There
are in the Government records at Washington countless
cases of German officers who, over their own signatures,
have written things so foul and filthy, so low, lewd and
bestial, that no pen on earth ever would rewrite them save
one of their own sort. The Huns were not clean-minded
fighting men, but in large percent animal-like, low, cruel,
cunning, unscrupulous, unchivalrous even in their most
arrogant ranks. This explains out of hand the atrocities
in Belgium and France and shows what atrocities were
waiting for America had this war been won by Germany.</p>

<p>Germany fell because she was rotten in heart and in
soul. That was why she fought foul—because she <i>was</i>
foul, foul to the core. It was an amazing and an abhorrent
“kultur,” this which she offered to the world. It is no
wonder that her ways of warfare were cruel, merciless,
unchivalrous; no wonder that she crucified men and tortured
women and children until there is no human way
ever of squaring the account with her. She no longer
belongs on the clear avenues of the world, and the one
epitaph she has earned is the one word, “Unclean!”
History has not usually recorded such statements. No.
And history has not usually been in the way of discovering
such truths.</p>

<p>It was this Dr. Scheele, an upper class German who
lived here twenty-five years as a spy, who, under German
Government order, started this friendly plan against America.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
You cannot call that military genius. You cannot
call such a man a soldier. His is simply an instance of
perverted intellect. It is not even to be dignified by the
term malicious. It is unmoral, base, intellectually obscene,
as Thierichens was emotionally obscene.</p>

<p>But Scheele himself, now grown old—for he was a
major when he came to America twenty-five years ago—is
to-day a pleasant man of genial manner. He used to
visit the home of one of his guards—to whom he stuck
very close in his walks on the street, the guard having
told him he would kill him on his first step toward escape—and
there he always was kind to the children. “He
was such a nice man,” said the guard’s wife—“so
courtly.” He is a very egotistical man, and it requires a
certain playing up to his vanity to get him to talk freely.
Yet he has talked freely, and has given much valuable
information to the United States. The men who accompany
him in his city walks would dearly love to drop him
out a high window or see him try to escape. They do not
love him.</p>

<p>But Scheele loves himself. Asked one time as to some
statement he had made, he took offense at suspicion of
his veracity. He, twenty-five years a spy in America, a
state’s-evidence man at last against his original country
which he thus betrayed in turn, at this imputation slapped
himself on the chest and said: “On my honor as a German
officer!” Great God!</p>

<p>In his statements he was not often found tripping. For
instance, when he said that 200,000 rifles for German revolutionists
were stored in a German club in New York,
its searchers did find evidence that rifles had earlier been
stored there, but later removed. Scheele was taken from
Washington to New York to point out these rifles. He
would not go with less than four men as a guard. He is
always afraid some German will kill him. Oh, yes, he is
still alive. The secret men of the United States know
where he is. He can be seen. He will talk. He is an
elderly, kindly-looking man now—a man who speaks of
his “honor as a German officer!”</p>

<p>The story of Scheele’s ferreting out is of itself a strange
and absorbing tale, which shows how our own men were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
on their guard. To begin with, his cigar bombs did not
work infallibly—perhaps the motion of the ship would
slop the acid away from the tin partition so it would
not cut through quite on schedule. One or two bombs
were found on shipboard. One or two were found unexploded
in the coal when ships were unloading at Bordeaux.
The bombs were traced back to New York. Dock laborers
had been bribed to put them aboard ships sometimes—and
sometimes were ashamed to do so and dropped them
into the water instead. Men who can decipher code can
run a trail like this. Scheele soon was located.</p>

<p>But Scheele had fled long before. Why? Whither?
The Imperial German Government knew Scheele was going
to be caught. The large spies of the German embassy
promised to pick Scheele up at Cuba—where he had taken
temporary residence under the practically German custody
of a Spaniard who kept him in a castle which also
was a prison. And so it came to pass that when the
embassadorial train of the Imperial German Government
was kicked out of America and all these big spies were
named openly, and all the news of that big spy system
began to break, von Bernstorff, von Papen and company
sailed for Germany—but they did not take any chances.
They did not stop at Cuba.</p>

<p>Scheele was abandoned by his people—he was an actual
prisoner in Cuba. He was bitter. He might talk under
a third degree. An A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. man of New York Division,
Richmond Levering, now Major Levering, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A., went
to Cuba, got access to Scheele, took him to Key West,
took him back again to Cuba—but took him back to an
actual prison. Then, finding he had no place in the world,
and no friend whose protection he could not buy, he sold
his “honor of a German officer” to the United States,
and in return, he is still alive, having paid as the price
of life the full story, so far as he knows it, of the German
Imperial spy system from Wilhelmstrasse to Brooklyn
Bridge.</p>

<p>And there you have a spy, a real one, a man who planned
murder and arson on the high seas, death to unknown
hundreds of men, women and children; the man who
invented the mustard gas that tortured and killed our boys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
and those of our allies on the line in France, and whose
perverted intellect did none may know what else of subtle
crime “on the honor of a German officer.”</p>

<p>Scheele made many revelations which never heretofore
have been made public, because they were humiliating and
shocking to us, and showed how completely we had been
befooled for years. He said: “We knew all you had,
everything, and we used all you had. You invented the
submarine—and we used it, not you. You invented the
airplane—and we used it, not you.” (Which is true,
as our boys in the Argonne battle would testify.) “If
you had had new gases, we’d have got them. We had
four men for years in your Patent Office, and you never
knew it. We knew every invention useful to us. We had
a man in your army secrets, one in your navy.”</p>

<p>“But how could you do such things—how could you
have men inside of our Government in that way?” interrupted
the man to whom he was unburdening himself.</p>

<p>“Good God!” said Scheele, “we’ve got them in your
Congress, haven’t we?”</p>

<p>It is enough. And now comes Dernburg and believes
that Americans will hail the “new understanding”
between Germany and America! He believes that we shall
be very good friends, now that the war is over.</p>

HANDLING BAD ALIENS</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Dealing with Dangerous Propagandists—High and Low
Class Disloyalists—The Alleged Americanism of the Kaiser’s
Kultur-Spreaders—A Few Instances of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
Persuasions.</p>
</div>

<p>In the early days of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L., Mr. Bielaski, Chief of
the Bureau of Investigations of the Department of Justice,
issued an explicit letter of warning and advice to all
League members as to their conduct regarding aliens. The
Attorney General often publicly denounced lynchings.
The Bureau of Investigation always counseled prudence
and full justice to all. Surely, the aliens, the unnaturalized,
the strangers and visitors of other races than our
own, caught in this country with or against their will by
the declaration of war, can offer no complaint regarding
the fairness and generosity of the treatment accorded
them. These enemies of ours, these spies, propagandists
and pro-Germans, had better treatment than they deserved
then and better than they deserve now. We have been
too temperate, too fair, too lenient with them. The moderation
of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. work, indeed, all our Government
work, with traitorous persons living in America, has been
a matter of astonishment to all the European nations, who
perhaps knew more of the alien enemy type than we did
ourselves.</p>

<p>A reference to the table of reports of all division chiefs
will show that investigations for “disloyal and seditious
utterances” far outnumber those under any other head.
The truth is that Germans and pro-Germans generally were
mighty cocky in their talk in this country. Arrogant and
assured that Germany was going to win this war—for
which, as most of her amateur and all of her special spies
knew, she had been preparing for many years—they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
talked as though they owned America and might say or
do what they liked at any time or place they pleased.
As against this offensive conduct, the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. showed two
phases. First, it saved many a German life, perhaps of
little worth, by preventing large and free-handed lynchings;
and in the second place, it exercised so potent an
influence on openly sneering and boasting pro-Germans
that very soon they ceased to talk where they might be
heard. That any such persons ever changed very much
in loyalty, that they ever gained any more love for our
institutions or felt any less love for those of Germany, the
author of this book, after reading some thousands of
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. reports of investigations, frankly does not believe.
That it was <i>fear</i> of justice in one or another form which
quieted them, this author frankly does believe. And that
<i>fear</i> only is going to hold down such citizens in the
future, he believes with equal frankness. In their hearts,
these people have learned no new principles, although in
their conduct they may have learned new counsels.</p>

<p>America handled her racial war problem as though she
were afraid of it. There is small ultimate benefit in that.
The only reconstruction policy—political, commercial or
industrial—by which America really can gain, is one which
is going to say: “This country is America. It has but
one flag.” It is time we laid aside our old vote-catching
methods, our old business timidities, and quit ourselves
like men. Indeed, it is impossible to get in touch with the
mass of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. testimony and not to feel bitter and
more bitter toward the traitors who have been left immune
under our flag—not to feel sure and more sure that we
have handled them too gently and to our own later sorrow.
All this is written in absolute deliberation, with a certain
feeling of authoritativeness. It has been given to few men
to read the mass of testimony which the writing of this
book necessitated. To do so was to sit in touch of the
greatest reflex of the real America that perhaps ever has
existed. We deal here not with theories, but with actual,
concrete facts.</p>

<p>We do not give authorized figures as to the alien enemies
interned, but it is sometimes said that we interned only
about five thousand aliens, that we paroled a very large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
number, deported a few, and revoked citizenship for only
two. It was said that the close of the war would set free
a great many of these persons who will resume their residence,
if not their former activities, in America. It is true
that we have not executed a single German spy. That is
an astonishing commentary on our laws and our Government
in times such as these. Let those who are wiser than the
writer of this book can claim to be after the extraordinary
experience of studying the real America, pass on the wisdom
of such leniency in its bearing on later Bolshevism in
America. Other nations certainly have acted otherwise.
Sometimes they have smiled at us as the easy mark of
all the nations.</p>

<p>Certainly, however, whatever may be the personal belief
of many citizens of this country, our public documents
prove the wish of our Department of Justice, all its Bureaus
and all its auxiliaries, to be just and more than just,
generous and more than generous, to those not in accord
with our laws and institutions,—a strange contrast for the
reflection of those “simple and kindly” folk who for four
years have exulted in the outrages Germany has wrought
upon the world, and who for four years have given the
world the most detestable examples of treacherous
espionage.</p>

<p>At times we did teach some of those gentry that there
was a God in Israel. If as yet we have deported few or
none of those interned aliens—all of whom, and a hundred
thousand more, surely ought to be deported—if we have
received back into our tolerant friendship those who have
been for some time warned out of our Government zones,
at least we have trailed down certain of the more active
cases of Kultur spreading in America. Space confines us
to very few of those, chosen almost at random from the
thousands at hand in the records.</p>

<p>The chief centers of alien enemy activity in this country,
as might have been expected, were the great industrial
towns and cities. It was in these places that the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
fought its hardest fights and achieved its greatest
triumphs.</p>

<p>The great city of Seattle was no exception. The report
of the splendid work it did all through the far Northwest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
ought by every right to appear in full. We must be content,
however, to extract from the Seattle record a couple
of interesting incidents of trailing aliens.</p>

<p>The first suspect was a German who had changed the
spelling of his name. Outer appearances were in his favor.
He resided in a good part of Seattle, in a good bungalow,
and showed all the insignia of the Red Cross, Liberty
Loans, etc., in his windows. He was unassuming in his
manner and openly talked patriotism. However, as the
case proceeded, it was found that he associated with a
domestic of a citizen, and that this domestic collected
Canadian bills and sent them to Canada. Tracing this clue,
the suspect <span class="nowrap">C——</span> was found to have come from Canada
where he had been interned. He had made his escape and
come to the United States without permission. He had a
covert postoffice box in the name of Joe <span class="nowrap">M——</span> (his real
German name was <span class="nowrap">K——</span>), and he had been an alien
enemy agent of Germany. He was arrested by an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
man, brought before Federal officials and later was interned
for the period of the war.</p>

<p>In the possession of this man there was found a long list
of names of Germans, all of whom were afterwards found
to have served in the German Army, but who were now
corporals or privates in the American Army. These men
were stationed mostly in forts on Puget Sound. Through
these men, <span class="nowrap">C——</span> had a well established system leading
into the Navy Yard of Puget Sound and the forts protecting
the harbors. There was taken into custody a photographer,
T——, who had in his possession photographs
of nearly everything in and about Fort Worden. <span class="nowrap">T——</span>,
who was associated with <span class="nowrap">C——</span> in some manner, was
given a hearing and released on ten thousand dollars
bail. The money was immediately put up by Germans
then under suspicion at Fort Townsend. At about this
time, <span class="nowrap">T——</span>’s house took fire and burned down. One
trunk was saved, of which he quickly took charge when
released on bail. There were other arrests made in this
case, regarding the final issue of which nothing can be
said at this writing. So much at least for the gentle and
unassuming Mr. <span class="nowrap">C——</span>, quiet citizen.</p>

<p>Seattle had another case which ended in an internment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
that of Gus <span class="nowrap">S——</span>, whose story is succinctly covered in
the words of the Seattle Chief:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Early in January, 1918, our organization was requested by
the Department of Justice to get a line on one Gus <span class="nowrap">S——</span>,
generally believed to be a German who worked along the
water front dismantling boats and storing the material, which
he afterwards sold for junk. Operatives <span class="nowrap">H——</span> and <span class="nowrap">B——</span>
were detailed on this case, and confirming the suspicions of
the authorities, it was established that <span class="nowrap">S——</span> had a cache
in a remote district of the Sound where he buried the stolen
articles until they had accumulated in sufficient quantity that
he could sell them wholesale.</p>

<p>It was found that he had four points established on the
Sound as headquarters; one of them situated about forty miles
north of Seattle where he could dodge in and out among the
numerous islands on the Sound and evade the authorities.</p>

<p>On the morning of January 9, 1918, one Dr. <span class="nowrap">W——</span>
voluntarily appeared at the office of the American Protective
League, 615 Lyon Building, stating that he was a German
and had done considerable intricate work in the Government
and that he was anxious to serve our organization. <span class="nowrap">W——</span>
was immediately placed under investigation, and it developed
that he was a German alien enemy, and was in the habit of
violating his alien enemy permit. It was also discovered that
he owned and occupied a houseboat on the East Waterway in
the ship-building district, in the prohibited zone on the water
front. This place was visited and examined. Our operatives
found documents proving that <span class="nowrap">W——</span> was an alien enemy
and a Reserve Officer in the German Army. He had on board
the houseboat an extensive chemical laboratory and a complete
chemical library in the German language; also technical books
on wireless and other matters of military importance. The
chemicals were seized, sent to the Immigration Department
and examined by a chemist. <span class="nowrap">W——</span> was placed under
arrest, given a hearing, and ordered interned for the duration
of the war.</p>

<p>It developed that <span class="nowrap">W——</span> had communicated with <span class="nowrap">S——</span>
and warned him of his approaching arrest, and that <span class="nowrap">S——</span>
had departed north in his boat. The League officers immediately
got in touch with their organization in Skagit County,
and operatives were detailed to watch for <span class="nowrap">S——</span>. When he
came into the Flats, they apprehended and placed him under
arrest and seized his boat. On board was found quite an
arsenal of assorted makes of guns. The examination took
place at the time an opportunity was being given alien enemies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
to register as such, and this opportunity was given <span class="nowrap">S——</span>
at the Immigration Station. <span class="nowrap">S——</span>, however, maintained
that he was an American citizen; he could not produce papers
but his explanation was as follows: That he had filed his
declaration to become an American citizen and that, by reason
of his activities against the law, he had been arrested and
sentenced to serve six years in the penitentiary at Walla
Walla; that while he was serving out his sentence, the date
for him to appear for examination and acquire his second
papers had expired, and that on account of his inability to
appear, this automatically made him an American citizen.
Therefore, he refused to register as an alien enemy. At the
conclusion of the hearing, <span class="nowrap">S——</span> was ordered interned and
sent to Utah.</p>

<p>S—— had, for the previous six weeks, been hovering
around the depot tanks of the Standard Oil Company. From
the association of <span class="nowrap">W——</span> and <span class="nowrap">S——</span> and the facts that
were disclosed in the investigation, there is no question in
the minds of the officers of the organization but that they
were about to cause an explosion at this plant as well as at
one of the shipyards.</p>
</div>

<p>Yet another good report from the Seattle Chief covers
the case of M. J. <span class="nowrap">B——</span>, alias W. J. <span class="nowrap">H——</span>, who apparently
was unable to keep all his life as secret as he might
wish. We cannot improve upon the report of the Chief as
it was written:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="nowrap">B——</span> appeared in Seattle early in December, 1917, and
took rooms at the <span class="nowrap">P——</span> Hotel. From his acts it was immediately
noted by our operatives at the hotel that <span class="nowrap">B——</span> was
receiving packages under the assumed name of W. J. <span class="nowrap">H——</span>,
which name he explained to the clerk was used as a code. He
received no visitors except two persons of foreign birth, and
it developed that upon going to the hotel he was without ready
money to sustain his expenses. Within a short time, however,
B—— was found to have not only sufficient funds to maintain
his daily expenses, but quite a surplus, which he was
using lavishly. He claimed to be a working man, but his
hands, dress and facial appearance were certainly those of a
man who was accustomed to appearing in society, and taking
life rather easy.</p>

<p>Following certain suspicious activities on the part of
B——, an investigation thereof disclosed the fact that he
was having considerable correspondence with Germans in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
United States, and that he had the names and addresses apparently
of every German in the United States. It further
developed that he had cards made in Seattle, representing
himself as being connected with a bank in Detroit. He was
placed under arrest and sent to the Detention Station in the
Department of Immigration to establish his nationality and
status. He claimed to have been taking orders for a toy balloon
concern on <span class="nowrap">W——</span> Avenue, the proprietor of which
stated that <span class="nowrap">B——</span> had worked for him on a commission
basis, but that his total commissions for the first year would
amount to about $86.00, approximately. This was the merest
trifle compared to the totals believed to have been spent by the
subject, and he evidently had some other source of income than
that derived from toy balloons.</p>

<p>The subject was well educated, spoke four or five languages,
and it developed that he had formerly held a commission of
lieutenant in the Austrian army. <span class="nowrap">B——</span> was a sketch artist,
very clever, and in passing through the country, was accustomed
to make landscape scenes of various places of interest
from a military standpoint—which sketches, together with
certain puzzle sketches, were believed by the officers of the
organization to be for the purpose of furnishing information
to the enemy.</p>

<p>The specific charge was thought by him to be that he was
an I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W., and he requested the permission of the Immigration
authorities to address a letter to a friend, which permission
was given. This letter, which, of course, was censored
by the authorities, addressed a German at Bremerton, close
to the Navy Yard, and complained of his arrest as an I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.
He informed this friend that he had done a great many things
which he “had been ordered to do,” but that he was not, nor
had he been, requested to be an I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W., and he requested aid
for his release.</p>

<p>A very complete examination was made of <span class="nowrap">B——</span> and his
entire movements since arriving in this country. It developed
that he was born at Frankstock, Moravia, in Austria; that he
was twenty-four years of age, had had military training, had
just completed same prior to departing for this country, and
was a Second Lieutenant in the 54th Royal Imperial Infantry.
He was in Hamburg and Paris during 1914, and just prior to
the outbreak of the war, he came to New York, passing through
England on this trip, since which time it developed that he
had been receiving money from Germany, and had been operating
in the cities of Hoboken, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Chicago,
Seattle, Helena and Spokane. Regardless of the fact that he
was heir to an estate in Austria and was supposed to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
reported to the consul (Austrian) in Seattle, he claimed he
had not done so.</p>

<p>In explanation of the alias, W. J. <span class="nowrap">H——</span>, he claimed to
have adopted that name simply because his name was funny.
It developed that <span class="nowrap">B——</span> had been previously arrested and
released, and had in his possession documents covering his
entire experiences, as well as information concerning his particular
case. Certain documents, undoubtedly codes, were
taken from <span class="nowrap">B——</span>, and the only information or explanation
he would give concerning them was that they were puzzles.
The subject was well acquainted with the German element in
each of the towns he had visited, many of whom were held
under suspicion by the authorities. It further developed that
he had made frequent visits to the ship-yards and to the Navy
Yards, and that he was intimately associated with certain
leaders of the order of the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. He was ordered interned,
and sent to Utah.</p>
</div>

<p>It never was urged against Seattle that she displayed
anything but live wire characteristics, and it is too bad
that we may not delve deeper into the Seattle files. The
Chief adds: “We have many other cases, perhaps of more
importance.” The existing records bear out the assertion.
But we must dismiss this big center of activity with only
a brief summary of tables showing six months’ work of
the Minute Men Division of the American Protective
League for Seattle. The situation revealed by this summary,
astounding as it is, and humiliating as it must be to
make the admission, is one that finds a parallel in the
experience of every great industrial center in America
during the war.</p>

<p class="p2">There came up in the Birmingham, Ala., Division the
character investigation of R. E. S——, a lieutenant in
the United States Army, reported to be in the Military
Intelligence Department, foreign service. This man lived
in Birmingham several years before the declaration of war,
and moved with the best people. He always seemed to
have enough money for the demands of society, although
his business was limited in its earning capacity. He attended
a training camp and received a commission, but
after he had arrived in France, the War Department requested
an investigation through the League. The result
shows that danger existed at all times from German explosives
even in the most jealously guarded places. Below is
given the substance of the investigation. The first operative
reported:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have known <span class="nowrap">S——</span> for several years, and have always
been impressed with his pro-German tendencies. He lived in
comparative comfort, belonged to all of the clubs and moved
in the best society. He never appeared to be lacking in funds
in spite of the fact that the income from his position, and later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
his business, did not warrant his living in this manner. It
was understood that he had no investments producing income.
I have thought for the past four years that he received money
from the German Government, and have so expressed myself
on many occasions.</p>

<p>Before we entered the war, <span class="nowrap">S——</span> was very bitter in his
denunciation of England for going into it. He claimed Russia
and France were responsible and that Germany was fighting
for her life. He stated that England would rue the day she
went in, and that nothing could stand against the Kaiser and
his great war machine. He considered the Kaiser the greatest
man on earth and the German people superior to all others.
He justified the invasion of Belgium as a war necessity and
the ravages of that country and of invaded France on the same
grounds. He gloried in the sinking of the Lusitania, and
stated that all who lost their lives on it deserved to do so.
He criticised the general policy of our government and President
Wilson.</p>

<p>When we entered the war, <span class="nowrap">S——</span>’s whole attitude changed
and immediately he was anxious to fight for his country. He
attended the first Officer’s Training Camp at Ft. McPherson,
Georgia, but was discharged in a short time. He was bitter
about this and stated he had not gotten a square deal.</p>

<p>I have discussed <span class="nowrap">S——</span> on many occasions with a great
many of my friends, and the consensus of opinion is that he
is entirely too pro-German to be in our Army in any capacity.
Many think he is an agent of the German Government. Personally,
I feel that he is an extremely dangerous man. I
would not care to serve in the Army under him as an officer,
and I would like to see him placed in such a position that he
could not possibly do us harm.</p>
</div>

<p>Another operative said he did not think <span class="nowrap">S——</span> a safe
man to have in the United States Army. In his presence,
S—— approved the sinking of the Lusitania, and said
that the people who lost their lives had no business on the
ship. He also stated that he had two brothers in business
in Germany before the United States entered the war.
Operative said that <span class="nowrap">S——</span> was strongly pro-German in
his sympathies. He regarded him as a dangerous man—particularly
dangerous if he was in the Intelligence Department.
Operative stated that he had no confidence whatever
in <span class="nowrap">S——</span>’s loyalty. He stated that <span class="nowrap">S——</span> admired
Germany and thought the Germans were the greatest
people on earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>A third operative prefaced his statement with the remark
that he was a warm personal friend of <span class="nowrap">S——</span> and did
not want to do him an injustice. He did say that <span class="nowrap">S——</span>,
before the entry of the United States into the war, was
intensely pro-German. On being asked if he would like to
be a private in a company commanded by <span class="nowrap">S——</span> and
pressed for an answer, he said: “Well, I would like to
know my captain hated the Germans a whole lot more than
S—— does.” He further said that if <span class="nowrap">S——</span> were to be
captured, he would very soon be on friendly terms with his
captors.</p>

<p>Follows a statement of an operative who had known
S—— for twenty-five or thirty years, and had been on the
terms of the best friendship for several years past:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Prior to the entry of the United States into the war, <span class="nowrap">S——</span>
was rabidly pro-German and expressed himself freely on any
and all occasions. He thought that Germany was all-powerful
and had nothing to fear from the United States. He favored
the German U-Boat policy, and said: “I am damn glad
of it!” when he read the newspaper notice of the sinking of
the Lusitania. He said furthermore that the people on the
ship got just what was coming to them, and they had no business
being on it. <span class="nowrap">S——</span> seemed to be thoroughly imbued
with the idea that the Germans are supermen, and that they
could do anything. He regarded the Kaiser as the greatest
man on earth. He took all the German papers in the country,
and received German propaganda from some source unknown.
When he went to the Officer’s Training Camp in Atlanta, he
wrote a card to one of his friends here asking him to forward
his mail but not to forward any newspapers. He was a constant
reader of papers of German tendencies. He stated in
conversation that the United States had no Navy, and that the
safest place for its ships was in our harbors; that there was
more danger to our sailors from our own ships than from anything
else. He seemed to have a great deal of information concerning
the armament and equipment of the United States as
regards cannon, small arms and vessels, together with the
number of men in our Army and Navy. Mr. <span class="nowrap">R——</span> did not
know where he got the information nor what he did with it.
S—— knew all the local anarchists and wild-eyed citizens
of German and Russian nationality. One day <span class="nowrap">S——</span> was
talking on the street with a friend when a rough, unkempt,
hobo-like man passed them. <span class="nowrap">S——</span> asked his friend to excuse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
him a moment as he wanted to speak to that man. He
conversed in German with the man for several moments, and
on his return said: “He is a Russian anarchist, and he told
me that a revolution is brewing in Russia and that the Germans
will not have to fight the Russians much longer.” He
always expressed great pleasure at any news which was favorable
to Germany. He did not think the United States had
any business entering the war. He has relatives in Germany
now.</p>
</div>

<p>When asked the direct question if he thought it advisable
for <span class="nowrap">S——</span> to be in the Intelligence Division of the
Army, operative said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I would not want to be in a company which he commands,
and I believe it highly dangerous for him to be in the Intelligence
Department. I believe if he was captured by the Germans,
he would have nothing to fear.</p>
</div>

<p>The report of this operative further says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>S—— had a twin brother engaged in the tea importing
business in New York. In July, 1917, the twin brother referred
to said that he would not fight the Kaiser, that he was
a German. He was even more rabid than the subject of this
report. It was rumored here for some time that <span class="nowrap">S——</span> was
a German spy but there was never anything definite to verify
the rumor, though he was very active in gathering all sorts
of information regarding the material resources of the United
States. He cultivated the acquaintance of the amateur wireless
operators here, and was a fairly expert telegraph operator
himself. Mr. <span class="nowrap">R——</span> stated: “If <span class="nowrap">S——</span> is in the Intelligence
Department in France, it is an extremely dangerous
thing and might cause a terrible disaster.”</p>

<p>After <span class="nowrap">S——</span> went to Washington last fall, and after he
had received his commission in the United States Army, he
wrote a letter severely criticising the United States War Department
for inefficiency. His strictures were of such a nature
that <span class="nowrap">B——</span> said to <span class="nowrap">R——</span> that he was very sorry that he
had read it. <span class="nowrap">S——</span> and <span class="nowrap">B——</span> burned the letter. This letter
criticised the methods of the War Department, stated that
things were badly handled, and that our preparations for war
were inadequate and inefficiently managed. This letter was
written after <span class="nowrap">S——</span> had received his commission as First
Lieutenant in the United States Army and was stationed in
Washington. A German friend admitted that <span class="nowrap">S——</span> was violently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
pro-German before our country entered the war. He
said that Germany had a right to sink our ships after giving
us warning of the restricted zone in which German submarines
were operating. He justified the sinking of the Lusitania, and
expressed no sympathy for the people who lost their lives,
stating that they got what they deserved as they had no business
on the ship. He justified the invasion of Belgium as a
war necessity, and condoned Germany’s violation of her pledge
to preserve the integrity of Belgium because it was a war
measure. <span class="nowrap">S——</span> regarded the Germans as a superior people,
and admired the Kaiser greatly. He was much opposed to the
entry of the United States into the war, said that he was so
sorry that we had gotten into it, and that it was not our affair
but England’s.</p>
</div>

<p>It has been thought advisable to take these widely separated
cases and to give them in detail rather than to present
summaries of a large number of cases which may or
may not have resulted in sentences or internments. An
examination of these instances will show the fairness and
shrewdness with which the League’s Chiefs and Operatives
worked, as well as their unflagging interest in the work
offered them. It also will be apparent that a single investigation
might involve a great deal of patient, hard work.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>
THE GREAT I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. TRIAL</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Story of the Greatest Criminal Prosecution Known in the
Jurisprudence of America—The Lawless Acts Leading up
to the Arrests—Methods of Violence Used by Members of
the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.—Sabotage and Terror—Chief Figures of the
Trial—Incidents from the Inside.</p>
</div>

<p>The greatest trial with which the American Protective
League was identified was the genuine <i>cause celébrè</i>
known all over the world as the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. trial. It began
in the Federal Court for Chicago, presided over by Judge
Kenesaw M. Landis (the same of fame in the Standard Oil
case), on April 1, 1918, and ended with ninety-seven convictions
and sentences in one lot. The case was concluded
at two in the afternoon of August 30, 1918.</p>

<p>The trial lasted for five months. The preparation for
it covered two years or more. The record is said to be
the most elaborate and complete ever prepared in any case
at law. The case was by no means a Chicago or Illinois
case, but was a national and indeed an international one.
The documentary and other evidence preserved in the
rooms of the Bureau of Investigation in Chicago is so
voluminous as to pass belief, and it includes more proof
of the depravity of the human mind than any like assemblage
of written and printed material known to man. It
is the record of the attempted ruin of this republic.</p>

<p>With this great case, the American Protective League
had been connected practically all the time from the date
of its own inception. It had men shadowing the suspects,
men intercepting their mail, men ingratiating themselves
into their good graces, men watching all their comings and
goings, men transcribing and indexing the reports, men
looking into the law in all its phases as bearing on these
cases. No one knows how many A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operatives, in all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
the states from Michigan westward, worked on this case
for months before an arrest was made. There were fifteen
lawyers, all of them members of the League, not one of
whom got a cent of pay, who worked for a full year helping
the Bureau of Investigation to brief the evidence.
There you see the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in action.</p>

<p>For months and years before the arrests, the Industrial
Workers of the World, as they call themselves, had been
notorious for their anarchy and violence. Countless acts
of ruthlessness had marked their career; millions and perhaps
billions in property had been destroyed by them;
their leader had been tried for the murder of a governor of
a Western state, though acquitted. Nothing lacked in their
record of lawlessness and terror, and they were inspired
by a Hun-like frightfulness as well as a Hun-like cunning
which for a time both excited and baffled the agents of the
law in a dozen Western States.</p>

<p>The I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. as an organization began, according to
their Secretary and Treasurer, W. H. Haywood, in 1904,
in an amalgamation agreed to by officers of the Western
Federation of Miners and the American Labor Union.
The theory of the band, reduced to its least common denominator,
was that of striking terror by secret acts of
violence. Their ethics were precisely those of the barnburner,
who works in the dark. What was their reason
for their acts? None. They all had had their fair chance
in America—more than a fair chance. But, because some
men had wealth, they thought they also should have, and
if it was not offered them free, then they would show their
resentment by destroying wealth and injuring those who
had it. Their plea was the wish to “aid the laboring man.”
God save the mark! They did more to hurt the cause of
labor than could have been done in any other way in the
world. They stained the name of this republic so black
that the most rabid labor unions in Europe protested and
disowned them. And they got their reward for that; or
at least some of them have, and more will have before the
tale is told.</p>

<p>Sabotage and strikes were the common methods of the
I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. organization, which at the time of the trial numbered
over 100,000 members, mostly scattered in the West<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
in many trades. They managed strikes in widely scattered
parts of the Union, and as they grew bolder, they planned
in war times a general strike of all branches of labor, all
over the United States. They first began work among the
lumber-jacks, then among the miners. They meant to include
all harvest hands in harvest time, all agricultural
labor, indeed, labor of every sort. It was the plan to
demand a six hour day and $6.00 a day, even for all farm
labor; which, as all Americans now carrying the war prices
of living can see, would inevitably have raised the price
of food unspeakably had it succeeded. When opposed,
they wrecked and burned and ruined, maimed, murdered.</p>

<p>“Big Bill” Haywood, the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. leader, execrated
“military preparedness.” He called sabotage—that is to
say, secret industrial wrecking—the “weapon of the disinterested.”
Perhaps in peace times our fatuousness as
a people would have caused us to pay small attention even
to the series of I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. outrages. We would have absorbed
the discomforts and the crimes in our old careless,
cowardly way. But now we were at war. We were making
ships and airplanes, cannon and small arms and munitions
and clothing and equipment. We needed the labor of
every loyal man as much as we needed money and soldiers.
And it was about this time that Frank H. Little (an
I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. leader who was lynched in Butte, Montana, soon
after) wrote a letter to the general board of the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.,
demanding that the board should take action against the
draft law requiring service in the Army.</p>

<p>This, coupled with the evidence of strikes, and the prospect
of paralysis in many essential government activities,
was going too far. It was known that the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. intended
to get at the marine workers, then all allied industries.
That would have meant the end of the war, or of
our activity in the war.</p>

<p>Now, therefore, these arrogant and lawless men, never
else than malcontents, became traitors. In order to work
out to the quotient of ruin these vague theories about the
“rights of man,” they cast aside what shred of patriotism
they ever may have had to cover their nakedness of manhood,
and declared themselves ready to cripple and leave
helpless before her merciless foe this republic of America,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
whose whole theory from the foundation has been that of
the rights of man, who fought in all her wars for the rights
of man and has asked only in this peace the recognition
of the rights of man. Ah, they were so wise, these ruffians!</p>

<p>But now they ran against our espionage law and its new
teeth. Secretly watched for months by the many agents
of the Government and its auxiliaries, the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. was
at last found with sufficient goods on it to warrant the
movement of the law’s forces. The charges were made
that I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. members had violated the espionage act;
that they had fostered strikes to delay the output in war
munitions; that they had spoiled industrial material; that
they had been guilty of acts of violence against men not
of their views; that they had violated the postal laws; that
they had violated the statutes against conspiracy. The
indictments were framed on those general lines, and the
long arm of Uncle Sam, not that of any state or county or
city, reached out for the accused.</p>

<p>By this time the agitations of the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. had covered
Montana, Arizona and Colorado, were reaching into Utah
and Nevada, and had Minnesota and Michigan next on the
list. But <i>pari passu</i> with the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. activities had gone
on those of certain other alphabetical organizations, to wit,
D.&nbsp;J. and A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.</p>

<p>Mr. Clabaugh, the storm center of the Chicago Bureau
of Investigation, worked long months with the Government
attorneys. Mr. Frank Nebeker, the trial lawyer, was an
assistant <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Attorney General of Salt Lake City, and
he was on this case for over a year. It was he who directed
the raids. He was assisted by Mr. Claude Porter, of Des
Moines, Iowa, <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Attorney for the Southern District of
Iowa—now Assistant to the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Attorney General in
Washington. Mr. Porter came on as Special Assistant in
place of Mr. Frank C. Dailey of Indianapolis, who had
resigned. These men and their aids brought together, as
has been said, the most elaborate legal records ever known.
<i>That they had the evidence</i> is proved by the results of the
trial—ninety-seven convictions out of the ninety-nine accused
and tried. The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. <i>got the evidence</i>.</p>

<p>These men and Mr. Clabaugh were all in conference with
U. S. Attorneys all over the country from Detroit west,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
and in conference with the governors of many states as
well. Everything was kept secret. Then, one day, a wire
flashed across the country which set the law afoot. At the
same moment, two o’clock, Central time, on the afternoon
of September 5, 1917, one hundred I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. offices were
raided. The Web had done its work! One hundred and
sixty-five frightened insects struggled where but now a like
number of arrogant and boastful traitors had strutted free.
At one time Mr. Clabaugh took down to the Department
of Justice in Washington a large trunk full of papers—incriminating
documents once property of the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.
It would take such reading of these unspeakable documents
by all the American public as these officers of the law gave
them, before America ever could know what foul sort of
traitors she has been welcoming here at her own table.</p>

<p>Some of these arrested suspects were bailed out, others
held in prison. Of the total arrested, ninety-nine were
brought to trial. The case began before that staunch fighting
man, Judge Landis—who had a son in the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> aviation
corps himself—on Monday, April 1, 1918, and a month
was spent in selecting a jury. In all this work, the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
was active, and more than once its men choked off alleged
illegal enterprises—for the defendants were desperate now.
The opening statement was made by Mr. Nebeker on May
2, and examination of witnesses followed for six weeks,
when the Government rested till Wednesday, June 19. Mr.
George Vandever, for the defense, made the opening statement
on Monday, June 24. Judge Landis charged the jury
Saturday, August 17. The jury brought in its verdict in
fifty-five minutes and on one ballot. The statements of
the prisoners were taken on Thursday, August 29, and
sentence was passed by Judge Landis at 2:00 P. M., August
30, 1918.</p>

<p>The jury had needed but little time for deliberation.
The judge in reading his instructions, dismissed the fifth
count of the indictment, charging a conspiracy to violate
the postal laws of the United States. After telling the
jury that it had exclusive domain over the determination
of the facts of the case, while it must take the law from
the Court, Judge Landis said it was within the province
of the court to give his opinion regarding the evidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>“But in this case I shall not do so,” said the court. “I
shall submit it to you free from expression of my own
judgment. Your decision shall be the last and only one
on the question of fact.”</p>

<p>He then explained the law of conspiracy at considerable
length, after presenting a brief digest of the substance of
the indictment. He announced that it was unnecessary to
prove explicit agreement to enter a conspiracy against the
defendants if there was circumstantial evidence that such
a conspiracy existed, judged by the facts and the actions
of the defendants.</p>

<p>“Mere passive knowledge of the criminal activities of
other persons is not sufficient to establish a conspiracy,”
he instructed. “Some participation, coöperation, must be
shown to establish the connection of any defendant, and
by evidence of fact and circumstances independent of the
declarations of other people,—that is, by evidence of the
defendants’ own acts. Until such evidence is introduced,
the defendants are not bound by the declaration or statements
of others. But after it is shown he is a member of
the conspiracy, he is so bound, providing the acts are in
furtherance of the common purpose.”</p>

<p>The court also instructed that if any defendants entered
the conspiracy after it started, knowing its purpose, they
were equally guilty as if they had been of those who
originally conspired, but he tempered this by suggesting
that they might all have been guilty of minor conspiracies
in different places, and he stated that if these were not
related to a common purpose, they were not guilty under
the indictment. He also announced that they might all be
guilty of the acts of violence set forth in the indictment,
and yet, if these were not related to a common conspiracy,
they were not guilty in the charge in the case.</p>

<p>Both sides professed satisfaction with the instructions.
The sentences of the Court sent Haywood and fourteen
others, his principal aids, to the penitentiary for twenty
years. Thirty-three men got ten years, the same number
got five years; twelve men got a year and a day, two men
got off with two days in jail, and two had their cases
continued. There was well nigh a train load of them that
started for Leavenworth federal penitentiary the next day.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
The Department of Justice could not find handcuffs enough
in the city of Chicago to accommodate all the prisoners
on that train!</p>

<p>The total time covered by these I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. sentences
amounts to eight hundred and seven years and twenty
days. The world is deprived of that much-too-independent
work in a time when the world needs honest labor. Haywood’s
boast that there are 100,000 uncaught and unrepentant
I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.’s in the United States alone is all the proof
needed of the nature of the men thus put away.</p>

<p>These men, like most under-cover criminals, were cowards.
Haywood’s face went white when he heard sentence
passed on him. The prisoners, but lately sneering and
arrogant, now sat overwhelmed. Their friends and adherents
also were stunned. The court room was filled with
armed <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Marshals and A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. men, all unknown and
all ready for trouble. There was no trouble. Dead silence
was in the room. All bail was cancelled, of course, and
the march to jail began.</p>

<p>What did the Government prove against the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.’s?
That they had been guilty of almost everything a depraved
mind could invent in the way of crime. The public is
already conversant with the argot of the band. The “sab
cat,” or worker of sabotage—secret destruction of property—was
a title of pride among them. “Wobblies,”
“high jacks,” “scissor-bills,” “bundle-stiffs”—all were
part of the personnel put in evidence. A “clock” was
divulged to mean a phosphorus bomb, intended to be fired
by the sun and set a wheat stack ablaze.</p>

<p>These men spiked a great many spruce trees so that mill
saws were ruined on the logs. They killed vineyards in
California, and claimed to have burned $2,000,000 worth
of wheat in that state alone. They not only burned wheat
in the stack, but sowed spikes to damage reapers. They
dropped matches and bits of metal in threshing machines.
They put emery in delicate machine bearings. In canning
factories they mixed the labels, so that grades were vitiated
for the vegetables sent out. They polluted or poisoned
canned goods with dead rats and the like in factories where
they worked. No doubt also they set forest fires, and
beyond doubt caused explosions that destroyed hundreds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
of thousands of dollars in property. They did this to
terrorize their own country in its day of peril. They were
not worth the name of men. You can not make citizens
out of such creatures. <i>Fear</i> is all they understand.</p>

<p>Their literature was a continuous blasphemy. Cursing
the name of the Savior was nothing to their writers. They
put lime in men’s shoes and burned their feet to the bone.
They had a special sort of club they used in attacking
“scabs.” It had short, sharp nails driven along it, painted
the color of the club so they could not easily be seen. The
victim would catch at the club to wrest it from his assailant.
It was then jerked through his hands, often tearing
out the sinews, always scarring and often maiming him
forever. Always they were cowards. To injure and not
destroy was part of their religion. “Strike while you
work” meant to disable a machine for a while and so to
stop work for the crew or for the whole plant. “Feed the
kitty more cream” meant to use more emery on bearings,
to do more dirt in factories, to wreck and mar and mutilate
more cunningly and covertly—and to escape by feigning
the innocent laboring man. If they were not all Huns,
they had the foul Hun imagination, and also the methods
of the Hun.</p>

<p>By December of 1918, the trial of a half hundred more
alleged I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. men was progressing at Sacramento,
California. The attempt of the prosecution there was to
show a nation-wide plot against the Government of the
United States. And again, A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. had the evidence ready,
ticketed and tabulated, for A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. covers all of the
United States and not merely one part. On January 16,
1919, forty-six of the defendants were convicted.</p>

<p>If we have 100,000 I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. members such as these yet
among us, and internment camps full of Germans and pro-Germans,
would there not seem need for a house cleaning?
It is time now for a new American point of view. We are
not going to allow America to be used as it has been by
these men. <i>Fear</i> at least they shall understand.</p>

THE SLACKER RAIDS</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>How the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. Made Patriots—Chasing the Slacker—Teaching
the Love of the Flag—Incidents of Western
Raids.</p>
</div>

<p>Even had Mr. Bryan’s famous prophecy come true, that
a million armed men would spring up over night and so
end at once any trouble America might presumably experience
in going to war, there still would have existed a
vast deficit in our Army, which at the time of the Armistice
had more than two million men armed and on the soil of
France, almost as many in training, and ten times as many
listed as army material if needed—although, to be sure,
they had not sprung up either armed or equipped, as perhaps
France or Great Britain could testify. The new draft
ages of 18 to 45 swept in a vast additional army under the
latest conscription act, although the first registration, those
of 21 to 31, had set on foot our first American forces—as
fine soldiers as ever stood on leather.</p>

<p>A great many phrases are made in time of war about
war itself, and most of these come around to the ancient
recruiting sergeant’s inviting motto recounting the glory
of dying for one’s country. The Napoleonic wars were
fought on the death-or-glory basis; but Napoleon got his
troops by rigid conscription. We fought this war on a
more sober basis of necessity. Most of us who are old
enough and wise enough to study human nature and world
politics knew that commercial jealousy, and not any abstract
theories about democracy and the rights of man, lay
basically under this war, as they have lain under most
other wars. And the boys of the world—youth being
resilient, of high pulse and low blood pressure, and believing,
as youth always does, that nothing wrong can happen
to youth and hope—were called on once more to fight the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
wars of the world, as the boys always have been asked
to do.</p>

<p>Youth and middle age volunteered, old age itself volunteered,
but the truth became obvious that our volunteer
army would not spring armed over night in sufficient numbers.
In fairness, we passed our draft acts, euphonically
termed “Selective Service Acts,” it being intended that
this action should bring America to its focus, and should
put under arms warm and lukewarm lovers of our flag alike.
As it seems to this writer, that originally was unfair only
in that it made the maximum service age too low. It cast
the burden of the war on the boys, the young men, most
of whom had never felt hate against any country, and
knew little about the causes of this war; for soldiers often
do not really know why they fight.</p>

<p>Under the weak American pacifist propaganda, there lay
much human nature and very much more of shrewd German
propaganda. Germany always has had this country
sown with spies and secret agents, as we have shown, and
always has counted very largely on the German-American
loyalty to the flag of Germany. That very able spy, Prince
Henry of Prussia, brother to that now very contemptible
but once very arrogant coward, William Hohenzollern,
carried back to his royal brother the most confident reports
regarding potential German forces in America. He was
especially well received in Milwaukee and Chicago, where
he was met and welcomed by officials not unmindful of
the value of the German vote.</p>

<p>We find all these influences enlisted to aid and abet any
natural reluctance of boys to go to war, boys of the noblest
and bravest souls, who none the less had mothers to weep
over them, sisters and sweethearts to hold them back. So
there became apparent, in more cities than one, the truth
that a great many young men had not registered, had not
filled out questionnaires, were deserting, or were in some
way evading the draft.</p>

<p>Very naturally, an intense feeling grew up against these
draft-dodgers and slackers, a feeling based on the fair-play
principle. If one man’s son must go, why not the next
man’s, especially as that next man might be a secret pro-German
trying to protect his blood as well as his property?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
But the blood had really nothing to do with the real question
between the government and the man needed with the
colors. The law was the law, and it played no favorites
after the exemption boards were done. The fit man of
proper age must show himself.</p>

<p>Orders went out, in the summer of 1918, from the Department
of Justice to throw the net for slackers. That
meant the immediate mobilization for police duty not only
of many soldiers and sailors, many policemen and all the
force of the Bureau of Investigation, but also of the entire
personnel of the American Protective League. With the
exception of the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. cases, the aid the Chicago division
of the League gave in the great raids of July 11, 12,
13 and 14, in 1918, was its most important single contribution
to the welfare of the country. The New York slacker
raids (of a certain publicity), those carried on also in
Philadelphia, San Francisco, and many other cities, were
all so similar in method, that the story of the Chicago
raids will describe them all.</p>

<p>The big slacker drive in Chicago meant the mobilization
of the entire League membership, and over 10,000 men
were enlisted from this organization alone as operatives in
the slacker search. These men interrogated over 150,000
suspects, and seized over 20,000; and they inducted into the
army, as willing or unwilling patriots, around 1,400 young
men of that one city who otherwise would not have served.
At one time they had herded on the great Municipal Pier
over 1,100 men, all of whom had to pass the night there.
Countless motor cars and wagons carried loads under
guard. A big tourist motor-bus was requisitioned also, and
all the street cars were packed. Hundreds of men were
crowded over night in the rooms of the Bureau of Investigation
in the Federal Building. The courts and jails were
jammed. Vacant store-rooms were filled with prisoners.
Mothers, wives, sweethearts, sisters, brothers and babies
made the Federal Building an actual bedlam when they
rallied to the attempted rescue. But the grist ground on
through, and the guilty were found and dealt with. Most
of the young men were glad enough to exchange a bed on
a stone floor for one in an Army tent. No doubt, most of
them made good soldiers afterwards. They were rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
passively than actively disloyal—and all of them were
young.</p>

<p>No announcement was made of the plans of the Government.
The word was passed silently that at a certain hour
the hunt would be on. Once begun, it was prosecuted with
energy and system. All the current ball games were visited,
and the crowds were told to file out at a gate, where
each suspect was asked to show his registration card. Motion
picture shows were treated in the same way, the perfect
districting and subdividing of the League’s force
making all this synchronous and smooth. Cabarets and
all-night places of all sorts were combed out. All the city
parks were patrolled at night, and many a young man was
taken from his young woman companion in that way.
Members of the League even donned bathing costumes,
and swimming out among the bathers at the beaches, plied
their questions there! They took in over one hundred
slackers out of the wet in that way.</p>

<p>At a thronged boulevard crossing in the loop district,
every motor car was stopped. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operatives met
every incoming railway train and were at the gate of
every train leaving the city. Countless homes and shops
were visited. Sunday picnics in the suburbs were inspected,
every theater and public building, every “L” road
station and steamboat landing was investigated and
guarded by men who made but one remark: “Show me!”
On one night of the four, 7,000 men in a short time were
gathered, held and taken to the police stations. Factories,
stores, saloons, the open streets, all yielded up their toll—many
innocent, many loyal, many negligent, many culpable
and many disloyal evaders who were trying to dodge the
draft.</p>

<p>In a vast wave, the vigilantes of Chicago, whose existence
was suspected by almost none of these, swept out
into the open. The guilty and the lukewarm alike, the
innocent and ignorant conscript and the veiled enemy
alike, got the largest and swiftest lesson in Americanism
this country ever had had up to that hour. It showed a
certain element that under the careless American character
there are vast capacities for self-government and a stern
respect for law and government. Many a pro-German has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
known in his soul since last July that about the most
uncompromising autocrat he ever met was a simple man
bearing not a scepter but a little badge.</p>

<p>In general, the raids met with no resistance, and though
there was confusion there was no disorder. The people
took it well, as might have been expected. Loyal Americans
would not object, disloyal ones dared not. The general
working out of the widely-scattered raids was admirable.
As to the rapidity and thoroughness of the League’s
work, it never has done better anywhere, because by this
time it had grown into a well-drilled and perfectly-organized
body of constabulary. As covering the public attitude
of this city towards the raids—similar raids were met with
worse receptions in other cities—a great daily, the <i>Chicago
Tribune</i>, printed the following editorial comment:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The object of the roundup of draft registrants was, of
course, to find those who are evading the law and bring them
into the service. But the results of the drive go considerably
beyond that. It has proved the splendid spirit of the community.</p>

<p>Americans do not like to be interfered with by officials.
They are not accustomed to it, and they resent it in normal
times, even when it is quite justifiable. But though it has
been by no means convenient to be stopped on the way to
work, interrogated, sent back home for credentials, or taken
in custody pending investigation, there has been in this roundup
a general good-natured acceptance of the process, and in
the vast majority of cases, a cordial co-operation with the
authorities.</p>

<p>A part of the credit for this undoubtedly belongs to the tact
and good sense shown by the draft authorities and the volunteers
of the American Protective League, who deserve congratulation
upon the skill with which they have accomplished
a by no means easy task with a minimum of friction and a
maximum of thoroughness. But if the authorities showed
good spirit, the public met them half way, and the total experience
proves the excellent morale now existing. Whatever
is necessary to get on with the war is accepted without
complaint. Virtually everybody wants to help. Furthermore,
the number of slackers found in proportion to the number of
men questioned is gratifyingly small.</p>

<p>The young manhood is sound. As it is called on for service
small or great, it will respond promptly and spiritedly.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>There are two distinct points of view as to the slacker
raids, so called, and criticisms as well as praise have come
to the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. for its part in them all over the country.
Naturally, no miracle was wrought in human nature. The
families of the men who were hid or shielded were no more
loyal after their men were taken than they had been
before. The conscientious objector experienced no stiffening
of fiber in his flabby soul. But even these would have
felt otherwise towards the slacker drives had they known
all the truth. Ask the men themselves who were inducted
into the army what they think about it now. Nine-tenths
of them will say that they are ashamed that they had to
be asked twice to go into the army. The other one-tenth
is the better for having gone, whether or not they will
confess so much. As a saving influence, a mere reclamation
enterprise, the slacker raids were a vast agency for
the public good. They were not man-hunters, but man-savers,
these men who conducted the raids.</p>

<p>Just one instance of this truth must serve for all the
many communities who engaged in this work and who
caught, in all, perhaps, a half million men for examination,
and held a tenth of all they caught. It is only a little
anecdote, but it makes the best answer possible to all the
critics of the Selective Service Act.</p>

<p>A gentleman came into the National Headquarters with
certain papers in the way of reports, and announced that
he was the Chief of the Akron, Ohio, Division. He offered
the usual apologies—by this time more or less familiar at
the book desk—that he had been able to do so little when
he had wanted to do so much in the work of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
“But there is one thing that I wish you would put in this
book,” he said, “to show people what this League has
done in the remaking of men. I don’t care whether you
say another thing for Akron, but I want to tell this story of a
man we saved.</p>

<p>“A young woman came to my office and complained of
her husband. ‘I am almost desperate about Joe,’ she said
to me. ‘He drinks and drinks, and hangs around the
saloons. He hasn’t given me a cent in eight months, and
I don’t know what to do. I—I love him. I don’t want
him to go. But do you think the army would do him any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
good. He doesn’t do anything for me and our baby.’</p>

<p>“‘The army will see,’ I said to her. So I went and
found her husband—in a saloon, drunk, shabby, dead to
all pride and all ambition, about as poor-looking material
for a soldier as you ever saw. ‘That’s Joe,’ said his wife,
when I brought them together in my office.</p>

<p>“Well, I sent Joe to jail to think things over. When he
was in his cell, his wife took him in a tray full of good
things to eat, some hot coffee, and all that sort of thing.
I went with her. ‘You see,’ I said to him, ‘how much your
wife is doing now for your support—more than you have
done for her in a year. What do you think about it now?’</p>

<p>“Well, he was inside the draft age, and we sent him
into the Army. We saw to it that his wife got her share
of his pay—the first support he had given her in many
months.</p>

<p>“I forgot about this case, so many others came in. The
days went by until not so long ago. After the armistice
was signed and just before I came down here, some one
knocked at my door. There came in a smiling young
woman, neatly dressed, a neatly dressed baby in her arms.
And with her was a tall, grinning, brown-faced, hard-bitten,
well-set-up young man, in the uniform of the United
States Army. He had a sergeant’s chevrons on his sleeve.
I did not know any of these people.</p>

<p>“‘That’s Joe,’ said the young woman. Then I remembered
it all. It made me feel rather funny—I couldn’t
really quite believe it.</p>

<p>“‘He does not drink,’ said the wife. ‘I am so glad he
went into the Army.’</p>

<p>“Well, maybe you think I’m not glad of my share in
remaking a man like that. It paid me for all my work
and worry in the League. I believe that our Division
would have made good if it had not done anything more
than just what it did for Joe.”</p>

<p>One does not know of any better summary of the slacker
raids than that conveyed by this simple little story from
one chief out of very many hundreds.</p>

Mountains—Tricks of the Slacker’s Trade—Running

of a Deserter—How a Southern Ranger Brings

</div>

<p>One of the earliest recollections of the writer’s boyhood
is that of seeing his father busily engaged in molding bullets
for his rifle on a certain Sunday morning—at that time
the old muzzle-loading rifle was still in use. The old gentleman
was with the Army Recruiting Service in the Civil
War, in a branch which at times was obliged to look after
men who were evading the draft or unduly prolonging
their furloughs, or who belonged to that detested group
of conscientious objectors and obstructionists who at that
time bore the local name of “Copperheads.” Some of
these men had ambushed and killed two of the Army men
sent out to bring them in, and as others of the force then
took up the matter, it was deemed wise to be alert and
well armed. The murderers were duly apprehended and
dealt with.</p>

<p>At that time we had a United States Secret Service
whose annals make interesting reading to-day—as, for instance,
the burial by Secret Service men of the body of
John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of President Lincoln.
That final resting place to this day is known to very few
men. There was, however, in Civil War times no Military
Intelligence Division, no censorship of the mails or cables,
no real system of espionage, and certainly no A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. We
had less need then than now for such extensions of the
arm of Justice, because then each army was fighting an
honorable foe—though both were mistaken foes—and because
our country then was not populated so largely with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
unassimilated and treacherous foreigners. There was some
spy work in that time on both sides, as in any war; but for
the most part, clean, straightaway fighting was the main
concern of both sides; and that war was so fought that
such a thing as honor did exist and could survive for both
combatants.</p>

<p>The Civil War had as one of its worst results the fact
that the rich new West and Northwest, then opening up
with the early railroads, came to be largely settled soon
after the war by a heavy foreign population, instead of by
young Americans who must otherwise have marched out
at the head of the rails, and not at the head of armies
from which so many of them never returned. Had there
been no Civil War, there would have been less of loose
immigration. Without that war, there would be no Non-Partisan
League in the Northwest, no German Alliance in
the Middle West, no Bolshevism in the cities of the East.
Nevertheless, even in that day of honorable warfare, when
men met foemen worthy of their steel and not cowardly
assassins, there existed men who had the craven heart.
There were deserters then as there always are in war,—and
sometimes they were sought out by men who molded
bullets of a Sunday morning, and who, having started out
after their men, did not come back until they had found
them.</p>

<p>To-day also we have deserters and slackers—let us say,
perhaps, with better color of excuse than in the old days,
because in some of the more remote districts of the United
States, far from the confusion of the crowded city life, in
sections where the world runs smoothly and quietly and
men are content, there existed no definite and concrete
local reasons for a man to go to war with a foe across the
sea of whom he knew little or nothing. Secure in the only
American part of America, sometimes the Southern mountaineers,
for instance, resented the draft because they did
not understand it. The bravest of the brave, ready to
fight at the drop of the hat, and natural soldiers, there
were among them many whose fathers joined the Federal
Army in the Civil War. They volunteered for that—but
they would not be drafted for this foreign war. They
made a brand of conscientious objectors—rather, say,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
ignorant objectors—who were dangerous to go up against
in the laurel thickets or the far-back mountain coves.
Very often, these men, when they learned how the flag of
this country had been insulted, how our women and children
had been murdered on the sea, were eager to join the
colors, and never again were they deserters or slackers—only
fighting men.</p>

<p>To this form of military evader among the simple outlying
people of the southern hills, there must be added a
great many deserters of foreign descent all over the country,
caught in the Selective Service Act. Some of these
had imbibed no real loyalty to America in their home associations;
much too often their environments were those of
other countries and not this. They heard another speech
than ours used as a “mother tongue”; daily saw customs
of the old world maintained, and not those of the new
world taken on. They had small heart for the war because
their loyalty to this country still was crude and unformulated.
Many of the foreign-born troops who fought so well
in France first joined our colors, not because they wished
to, but because they had to, the law leaving no option.
After that, they learned the fierce love of a real soldier
for the real flag of a real country. Perhaps their wounds
and their deaths may teach their surviving relatives in
America not to remain foreigners, but to become Americans—and
not foreigners masquerading as Americans.
Some of our best soldiers had fathers who had taken the
German oath never to renounce fealty to that famous
“War Lord,” chiefest coward of them all, who had not
courage to die at the head of his army.</p>

<p>There was also in this war, as in all other wars, a certain
percentage of the sullen and rebellious, of the weak and
cowardly, men of no mark and no convictions in any cause,
men who never rise above themselves and their selfish
concerns in any situation. Beyond these, again, was a
small class whose natural home longings or home bewailings
or home pleadings led them to desert. Because of
many reasons, then, a certain percentage of deserters
marked this war as every war.</p>

<p>In the eyes of the law this was every man’s war, and
all must get under and back of it with no exceptions. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
deserter was a deserter. Some were dangerous men, and
some no more than yellow slackers. We could not in these
pages give a great many instances of either type. One
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. report, however, that comes from Birmingham,
Alabama, is peculiar in that it gives details regarding several
investigations and arrests of deserters.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable cases handled by the Birmingham
Division was that of Dan <span class="nowrap">D——</span> of Tuscaloosa
County, who deserted from the regular army of the United
States on November 27, 1917, and was not captured until
September 1, 1918. Information having been received by
the Chief on the 23rd of August, 1918, that Dan was hiding
near Reno Mines, he immediately ordered a number of his
men under Special Agent <span class="nowrap">M——</span> to go after the deserter.
The trip was taken in automobiles on the afternoon of
August 23, and through very heavy mist. Arriving at
Reno Mines, some information was given the party as to
the location of the man’s home, which proved to be a four-room
boxed house in front of which and about sixty feet
away was a small frame barn about twenty by thirty feet,
built of rough plank, with four horse stalls in the main
building and some cow stalls in the lean-to shed.</p>

<p>A careful search of house and barn failed to show any
signs of the missing man, his parents and sister denying
any knowledge of his whereabouts. The mother said, “The
last I hear’n of Dan was a letter from Long Island two
months or more ago,” and she remarked, “Of course,
you’uns know he was home on a furlough last November.”
A request to produce the letter was met with the reply,
“The chillun tore it up.”</p>

<p>The search of the barn was again renewed by the men,
and the loft was searched with the aid of a ladder from the
outside. It was found to be filled with fodder, hay and
grass, and prodding with poles and forks convinced the
parties that there was no chance for any one to be hiding
under same.</p>

<p>Very much mystified, and yet satisfied by the demeanor
and sullen manner of the father, mother and sister that
Dan was somewhere close, the Special Agent divided his
men, leaving part of them to watch, while the others
sought for outside information.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="nowrap">W——</span>, a Deputy Sheriff of Tuscaloosa County,
had been trying to locate Dan for ten months, and had
watched continuously as much as ten days at one time,
both house and barn. A number of searches prior to the
arrival of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. squad, made in and around the
mines of the different operating companies, had given no
clue. One thing was certain, however: nearly everybody
in the district was related to him, due to the intermarriage
during several generations of the people, and, as usual,
there were some of his own kin-folks who would “shore
like to see him pulled.”</p>

<p>At last, the patience of the party being exhausted, and
feeling sure that Dan was somewhere, either about the
house or barn, the father, William <span class="nowrap">D——</span>, and the
mother, and a sister, who had denied any relationship to
Dan, were told positively either to surrender him or go to
jail. They asked for time, and it was refused. They
pleaded for the officers to come again to-morrow. This
also was refused. After pleading again to give them till
afternoon, they finally asked one of the League operators
to a conference behind the house with the mother and
father. They then renewed their pleadings for time, but
finally agreed to show the hiding place of their son and
deliver him to the party, as they now realized that the
“U. S. was a blame sight stronger than kin-folks who were
liable to split on you at any minute.”</p>

<p>The father was then accompanied to the barn. He
knocked on the wall of the barn and said, “Come down,
son!” Almost immediately a wide plank in the floor of
the barn loft, almost over the heads of the astonished men,
mysteriously arose from its resting place, revealing the
most unique and simple hiding place imaginable. It was
nothing more or less than a box, about as large as a
good sized coffin, in which there were bed clothes, food
and water. The box was cut to fit the joists, hiding all
joints, and being apparent from below as a part of the
loft floor. It was covered with fodder and hay above, the
occupant using one loose plank of the box as his trap
door. When occupied, it would naturally be as tight as
any other part of the floor. Later, the party saw a hole
dug out under the cow stall which he had occupied until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
his more palatial quarters in the coffin box had been provided.</p>

<p>The District was noted in years gone by as the “favorite
stamping ground of Jim Morrison and kindred outlawed
spirits.” Most of the inhabitants of the surrounding country
are employed in the mining of brown iron ore, which
is taken out of large open cuts and washed by machinery
and shipped to the furnaces of the Birmingham district.
Nearly all of the labor, black and white, are the descendants
of small farmers of Tuscaloosa County and the southern
part of Jefferson County. Many of them still carry
on farming in a small way, and the region has long been
famous for its smooth and creamy “moonshine,” which in
some mysterious way still continues to be made. It was
for many years a favorite pastime of old Judge Shackelford,
who lived and died in sight of the <span class="nowrap">D——</span> home, to
mix his corn juice in an old sugar bowl while dispensing
justice in the good old way. Shortly after the events narrated
here, the sheriff of the county was murdered in cold
blood on the village street by one of the outlaws of the
section.</p>

<p>Two other interesting cases handled by the Birmingham
Division concerned two brothers, <span class="nowrap">S——</span> and <span class="nowrap">R——</span>.
S—— deserted from Camp Pike, Arkansas, October 5,
1917, and <span class="nowrap">R——</span> from Camp Mills, N. Y., September 25,
1917. The peculiar part of the case was that while <span class="nowrap">S——</span>
was listed as a deserter, the War Department had no record
of <span class="nowrap">R——</span> deserting, though they were advised that
he was in this section of the country and efforts were made
to check the records. While their desertions took place
the latter part of 1917, it was not until August, 1918, that
Operative No. 202 of the Birmingham Division received
confidential information that both men were in Shelby
County, Alabama, making moonshine whiskey, which they
were selling to the miners and also to citizens in Bessemer,
Alabama, a town thirteen miles southwest of Birmingham.</p>

<p>A party was organized to go after them, but unfortunately
missed them by four days, the brothers and their
family having moved elsewhere. Operative continued giving
the case active attention, and finally information was
secured that the brothers were in Coosa County, Alabama.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
Arrangements for automobiles having been made over long
distance, a party of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. men, six in number, headed
by Agent Crawford of the Department of Justice, left
Birmingham at 3:50 P. M. Thursday, November 7 (the day
made famous by the premature Armistice celebration),
arriving at Goodwater about 6:00 P. M.</p>

<p>After supper they were met by two 100 per cent American
volunteers with automobiles, and were driven about
five miles beyond Goodwater. The latter informed them
of the danger of arousing these parties by going over the
regular road, on account of dogs barking, so they left the
machines about two miles away from the cabin they were
seeking and detoured over a large hill, in the dark and
cold, to get to the cabin. The report says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The humorous part of it was that, in spite of our precautions,
the “hound dawgs” treed us about a mile from the
place and certainly let forth unearthly baying. By the time
we reached and surrounded the cabin, the entire household
was aroused. Again we seemed doomed to disappointment,
for we were informed that the parties we sought had left there
just four days before—the same length of time by which we
missed them in Shelby County.</p>

<p>After exploring the country in the immediate vicinity we
finally secured a tip that the brothers were near another town
about forty miles away, so we regained the machines and returned
to Goodwater, arriving there about 10:30 p. m. Feeling
that perhaps some word might reach the parties that we were
after them, if we postponed the trip, our drivers, after much
discussion finally agreed to drive us to Kellyton, Alabama,
about ten miles from Goodwater, to a man who ran a jitney
line. It was the coldest night of the year, with only the stars
as light. Finally we reached Kellyton, shortly after midnight,
and while two of us were arousing the jitney man the others
collected leaves and firewood and in a few minutes had a roaring
fire by the roadside to warm our frozen extremities.</p>

<p>Until we acquainted the jitney man with the urgency of the
matter, he demurred about getting out in the cold, saying he
had only two Ford cars and would have to depend on a thirteen-year-old
son to drive the second car of the two. He was
persuaded to take us over the thirty miles of rough country
roads, with our drivers rather uncertain of the correct route.</p>

<p>We reached Wadley, Alabama, about five o’clock in the morning.
Some coffee filled a long-felt want and in a few minutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
we were ready again. Further investigation, at Abanda, developed
the fact that the two suspects were with their family,
who had just moved in a country house about a mile distant
from the town. This house was in a hollow, off the road, well
shielded from view, and the surroundings made it an ideal
place for those seeking seclusion. Bearing in mind the fact
that in the rural districts most every one is suspicious of
strangers, we duly surrounded the house about 6:30 A. M. At
a signal the house was rushed and the men were in the center
passage of the house before the occupants were aware of their
presence. Hearing the noise, the mother opened the door to
one of the rooms and looked out. Seeing these strange men,
she tried to close the door, but was prevented from doing so
by one of the men who stuck his foot in the opening. On
being questioned the mother denied that the boys were there.</p>

<p>The house was the usual country cabin, with rooms on each
side and a hall down the middle, so while the two members
were forcing the door where the mother was, Agent Crawford
broke in the door across the hall and discovered the two
brothers on pallets on the floor. They were promptly covered
before they had a chance to use their pump guns, though
search revealed three of the guns fully loaded and placed for
convenient use. Also, an extra box of cartridges was found
with the top off. Had it not been for the quickness with which
we worked, trouble would doubtless have ensued, as the reputation
of these men was that they shot first and asked questions
afterward. One member of the family had the reputation
of killing at least two men and had they been given a chance
they would have resisted.</p>

<p>The boys were ordered to dress and placed under arrest.
Both of these men were big, strapping fellows, weighing about
175 pounds apiece, and each of them six feet tall. They had
no dependents, so there was absolutely no excuse for their
failure to serve their country. It usually is the case in the
rural districts of the South that nearly everyone is related to
everybody else, and all are “quick on the trigger” if they think
their relatives are being sought. It is interesting to mention
that the house where we captured the brothers had new barbed
wire fencing almost completely surrounding it, as if they expected
a little trench warfare of their own. Though we have
handled numerous other cases, I believe the circumstances
surrounding this particular one will long linger in the memory
of those composing the party.</p>

<p>The Local Agent of the Department of Justice at Birmingham
had many times received information that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
were a number of deserters and delinquents in the swamps
of Pickens County, Alabama. The local office there being
unable to cope with the situation, on Monday, December
10, a D.&nbsp;J. man, Robert <span class="nowrap">B——</span>, went to Gordo to secure
information as to the location of these men. The information
was secured. Mr. <span class="nowrap">B——</span> then proceeded to Tuscaloosa
where he called the Special Agent over long distance
phone asking that eight A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. men be sent to join him
in Tuscaloosa. Eight picked men of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. assembled,
and with three high power automobiles, left Birmingham
at 9:00 A. M., December 11, arriving in Tuscaloosa at noon.
At four o’clock the party left Tuscaloosa, going to a point
two miles from Gordo where deputy sheriff <span class="nowrap">D——</span> met
the party. <span class="nowrap">D——</span> was thoroughly familiar with the surrounding
country.</p>

<p>Leaving the automobiles about two miles from the first
house that was to be covered, the party very quietly surrounded
the house, not overlooking the barn and out
houses. They had been informed that the alleged deserter
had been staying at this house, the owner being his step
father. The whole place was searched, no evidence being
found. The step father and young brother were put under
arrest. This, however, failed to accomplish the desired
result. The mother was in her bed, an old-time, worn-out
umbrella beside her. Before the Assistant Chief could
catch her hand, a heavy blow was accurately placed on his
head, the old lady remarking, “I am damn tired of all this
foolishness!” She was gently relieved of the umbrella and
convinced that the bed was the place for her.</p>

<p>A younger daughter, about the age of fifteen, left the
house at this time by a back entrance and ran a mile to
another step brother’s house, with the evident intention of
notifying her step brother who was wanted. This was the
undoing of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L., as far as this deserter was concerned.
Another step brother of the deserter, however,
was placed under arrest, handcuffed and brought to jail
for harboring a deserter. Operatives discovered notices
that had been put on different houses in the locality of
this deserter, one of them reading: “You are talking too
damn much. The first thing you know the sun will rise
under your house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>The party then proceeded to the house of another deserter.
The house as usual was surrounded. One of the
operatives discovered an open window with a blind, the
window being about two feet square. While a search light
and a good gun guarded the entrance, Agent <span class="nowrap">B——</span> and
an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operative crawled through this opening in the
room. After awakening the occupants, a deserter and the
mother of another deserter were found. The deserter was
forced to dress. The mother was closely questioned regarding
her son, and finally agreed that if she would be
allowed to go alone, she would bring him to us. This was
agreed to. She was watched and in about fifteen minutes
she brought her son, who was a deserter, and also her husband.
It was discovered that the son and father were
sleeping in a ditch about one hundred yards from the
house. They had bed clothing, and slept in the open air
with the sky for a roof. These two also were handcuffed
and brought to jail.</p>

<p>The most interesting case on this trip was the capture
of another deserter who had been away from camp for
over a year. He and his wife, it is alleged, had sworn
that he would never be taken alive. The information was
that they had bought a lot in the community cemetery
where they were to be buried together. Arriving at the
house of the deserter at 2:15 A. M., the house was covered
and each operative given detailed instructions. The deserter
was called to the open door, and was warned not to
offer resistance, as his house was fully surrounded. When
told he was wanted by Uncle Sam’s men, he opened his
door and offered no resistance, stating that he had made
up his mind to surrender to government officers, but not
to the local officers. Judging from the weapons that he
had by his bed, he evidently meant what he had said. He
too was handcuffed and brought to jail. The total mileage
of this trip was two hundred and sixteen miles, all without
a scratch to car or man.</p>

<p>Lexington, North Carolina, was in this same mountain
country which furnished so considerable a number of deserters
during the war. It is a strange thing to say, but
perhaps the largest numbers of deserters were found in the
most American and most loyal part of the country—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
is to say, the South, where there was almost no alien population.
The only pure-bred American population in the
United States was the very element which seemed unwilling
to support the war! This, however, is a statement
which needs full explanation. Let the Chief of Lexington
make that explanation in the story of one case.</p>

<p>Tom <span class="nowrap">B——</span> was a Tar-Heel tie hacker and lived in the
mountains of North Carolina, twenty-six miles from a railroad.
He could neither read nor write, but was straight and
strong, and to see him swing a broad-axe was worth a trip
into the mountains. When Tom heard of the draft he did
not understand it. He had led a life of peaceful seclusion.
There were two old Germans over at the railroad that ran
a store, but Tom could work up no enthusiasm about crossing
the Atlantic to kill people of that sort. But the draft came
and many of Tom’s meantime friends disappeared. It
seemed inexplicable to him. He did not want to go to war
with anybody and did not understand why there was any
war. The solution of his problem at last came to him.</p>

<p>His people had come to these mountain fastnesses because
there they found that liberty of thought and action which
all our early Americans longed for; but now into that freedom
of action there came some intangible influence which
he could not understand. Tom simply resolved to march
into the forest as his great-grandfather had done. He
“stepped back into the brush” for the duration of the war.
For him this was the only natural solution for a problem he
did not understand. In this way he could escape what
seemed to him oppression and impairment of the liberty
which he held more dear than life. So he made the usual
arrangements. Food would be left for him at a certain spot
by his people. If anyone came in looking for Tom, his
people would put up a smoke signal so he would understand.
Meantime, Tom continued his work in a tie camp, his squirrel
rifle leaning against a tree. When he finished his work, he
“stepped back” into deep laurel and was lost as though he
had gone up into smoke. His decision, having been taken,
would remain unshakable even unto death. He said, “I
reckon I made up my mind, and I’d ruther die here than in
Germany.”</p>

<p>Let us consider the situation. Here is Tom <span class="nowrap">B——</span>, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
American of native blood, afraid of nothing that rides, walks
or swims, willing to fight his weight in wildcats to defend
the freedom and liberty of his native hills—and he is a
fugitive from justice. Now, how can the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. save that
man from the consequence of his folly?</p>

<p>He was saved. As soon as the Chief heard of Tom
B——’s disappearance, he packed his timber cruising kit
and went out into Tom’s country. At night he reached the
cabin of Uncle John Coggins, who knew everybody in that
neck of the woods and whose word was law. Uncle John
knew what was up, but he said nothing—only kept his small
blue eyes fixed on the visitor. After they had finished their
meal, the two went out and sat on a log in the sun, in the
middle of a clearing where no one could approach without
being seen in time.</p>

<p>“I understand,” remarked the Chief casually, “that Tom
has stepped back into the brush.”</p>

<p>No sign from Uncle John that he had heard anything.
Tom’s name was not mentioned again.</p>

<p>Then the talk was shifted to the war and other things.
The chief tried to explain to Uncle John the problem of
raising the army. He tried to bring home the war, across
the thousands of miles of sea and land, to this old man sitting
on a log in the western North Carolina mountains. He
pointed out the purpose and the manifest fairness of selective
service, taking all alike from all ranks.</p>

<p>Then they talked about the weather and the crops and
the soaring price of corn “likker” and the growing scarcity
of good white oak timber. The Chief went away. Uncle
John, when he said good-bye, understood perfectly why the
visitor had come to his cabin.</p>

<p>Several days later Uncle John appeared in the office of
the Chief. He drew up a chair and remarked, “Howdy,”
and sat gazing at the other man with about as much animation
as an Egyptian mummy. Only his little snappy eyes
under the bushy brows told of his alertness. The conversation
was again about the weather, the crops, the soaring
price of corn “likker” and the growing scarcity of good
white oak timber. At length Uncle John hitched his chair
closer.</p>

<p>“I kinda tho’t you all mought wanter know ’bout Tom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
B——,” he said. “I’ve done been out whar Tom is
a-settin’ back, an’ he seed how hit is—an’ he’s a-comin’ in!”
The Chief of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. nodded. The thing was settled.
They smoked for a time, discussed the weather, the crops,
the soaring price of corn “likker” and the growing scarcity
of good white oak timber. Tom’s name was not mentioned
again. The Chief spoke quite casually of a few details that
would naturally attend Tom’s “comin’ in.” Uncle John
said he would attend to those matters. A little later he went
away. And by and by Tom <span class="nowrap">B——</span> came in and joined the
Army.</p>

<p>These Southern leaders understood the mountain people.
Their method of work was infinitely more simple than
sending a posse out into the brush to round up a desperate
man who knew how to shoot to kill. There were characters
who needed other methods; but among the boys in
the mountains, ignorance and aloofness were the common
causes of their “stepping back into the brush.” To have
called any one of them afraid to fight would have been
the deepest insult possible to men of their race. Once in
the army, they did fight—the records of the Army will
speak as to that. There never were better or braver soldiers
in the world, nor men more loyal and devoted to their
country.</p>

<p>Olympia, Washington, had an interesting case of a deserter
named <span class="nowrap">G——</span>, whose father made the statement
that anyone who took the boy would have to come shooting.
The house was searched but the boy was gone. The
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operative later became a game warden, and while
traveling in the country ran across an empty cabin. As
it was known that the boy’s father had taken out a trapper’s
license, they thought that perhaps this cabin might
be occupied by the deserter. It was in a swamp, built
under overhanging trees, so it was almost impossible to
find. There was no trail to the cabin, as the boy did not
go in and out in any regular way but took different paths
to avoid discovery. The operative and an associate went
into the woods, found <span class="nowrap">G——</span>’s line of traps, followed
them up and captured him in the woods. This deserter’s
family would not buy Liberty bonds but said they would
save their money for ammunition. The prompt and vigorous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
action of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. closed a case which was notorious
in the vicinity.</p>

<p>A study of the reports of operatives engaged in League
activities at the busy Birmingham Division, and indeed all
over the country, shows an astonishing lack of anything
like personal violence. It never could be told, however,
where such an instance might break out. Only two or
three cases of killing in the course of duty are recorded
in the thousands of cases handled. One of these comes
from a quiet little farming village, Morris, Illinois, about
the last place in the world where anything of the sort
might have been expected. It resulted in the shooting
down, in the uniform of our Army, of Private A. J.
K——, Company D., <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Infantry, a deserter from
Rock Island arsenal. <span class="nowrap">K——</span> had escaped from confinement
at Rock Island with Corporal George <span class="nowrap">S——</span>. Acting
Sheriff <span class="nowrap">S——</span>, who also was Chief of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
at Morris, accompanied by Chief of Police <span class="nowrap">A——</span>, had
been advised to be on the lookout for two deserters who
were reported to be bad men.</p>

<p>The two men were on top of a box car when a train
pulled into town, and were accosted by the Sheriff. They
claimed to be government guards, and were asked to show
their papers. A weapon was seen in <span class="nowrap">S——</span>’s pocket.
The other man, still on the top of the car, covered the
two peace officers and ordered them to keep away or he
would shoot. At last the Sheriff managed to get the drop
on him before he fired, but meantime the train began to
pull out, so no shooting ensued at that time.</p>

<p>Morris wired Joliet to arrest the soldiers when the train
got in. The man hunt now was on, because other officers
down the valley reported the men wanted for desertion.
The two fugitives left the train at Durkee’s Crossing and
hid in the woods near the tracks. The Sheriff got a posse
and following down the track, located the men and surrounded
the wood where they were concealed. The chief
got up to <span class="nowrap">S——</span> unnoticed, covered him with a rifle and
told him to come along, which he did. He then asked
S—— where the other man was.</p>

<p>Just then, <span class="nowrap">K——</span>, who had not been seen, called to
the officer to drop the gun or he would shoot. Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
threatening talk ensued on both sides and <span class="nowrap">K——</span> advanced,
the officer still commanding him to drop his gun
as he was under arrest. <span class="nowrap">K——</span>, in turn, demanded that
the chief should drop his rifle, holding him covered fair all
the time. The Chief then called for his men to fire. Patrolman
Wm. <span class="nowrap">M——</span> fired on <span class="nowrap">K——</span> with his rifle, and
K——dropped. He did not die immediately, and was
taken to the hospital in Morris that night. The patrolman’s
bullet passed through his left shoulder, cut through
the lung, and lodged near the heart. <span class="nowrap">K——</span> refused to
talk. His companion talked more freely, and said that
K—— was bad and had had a shooting difficulty in
West Virginia. They had both been in confinement, and
had escaped with the intention of going back to West
Virginia. He said that <span class="nowrap">K——</span> “was the best shot in the
regiment, and was a ‘killer.’” That the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. Chief
was not himself killed is nothing less than a marvel.</p>

ARTS OF THE OPERATIVES</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Midnight Camera—The Way of a Man and a Maid
and a Dictagraph—Secret Inks and Codes—Stories of
the Trail—How Evidence Was Secured.</p>
</div>

<p>It already has been stated that the American Protective
League had no governmental or legal status, though strong
as Gibraltar in governmental and legal sanction. The mails
are supposed to be sacred—the Postmaster General has
sworn they always shall be sacred. They are sacred. But
let us call the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. sometimes almost clairvoyant as
to letters done by suspects. Sometimes it clairvoyantly
found the proofs it sought!</p>

<p>It is supposed that breaking and entering a man’s home
or office place without warrant is burglary. Granted. But
the League has done that thousands of times and has never
been detected! It is entirely naïve and frank about that.
It did not harm or unsettle any innocent man. It was after
the guilty alone, and it was no time to mince matters or
to pass fine phrases when the land was full of dangerous
enemies in disguise. The League broke some little laws
and precedents? Perhaps. But it upheld the great law
under the great need of an unprecedented hour.</p>

<p>A man’s private correspondence is supposed to be safe
in his office files or vault. You suppose yours never was
seen? Was it? Perhaps. It certainly was, if you were
known as a loyal citizen—a true-blood American. But the
League examined all of the personal and business correspondence
of thousands of men who never were the wiser.</p>

<p>How could that be done? Simply, as we shall see. Suppose
there was a man, ostensibly a good business man, apparently
a good citizen and a good American, but who at heart
still was a good German—as hundreds of thousands of
such men living in America are this very day. This man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
has a big office in a down-town skyscraper. He is what
the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. calls a “suspect.” Let us call him Biedermacher.</p>

<p>About midnight or later, after all the tenants have gone
home, you and I, who chance to be lieutenants and operatives
in the League, just chance in at the corridor of that
building as we pass. We just chance to find there the
agent of the building—who just chances also to wear the
concealed badge of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. You say to the agent of
the building, “I want to go through the papers of Biedermacher,
Room 1117, in your building.”</p>

<p>“John,” the agent says to the janitor, “give me your
keys, I’ve forgotten mine, and I want to go to my office
a while with these gentlemen.”</p>

<p>We three, openly, in fact, do go to Biedermacher’s office.
His desk is opened, his vault if need be—it has been done
a thousand times in every city of America. Certain letters
or documents are found. They would be missed if taken
away. What shall be done?</p>

<p>The operative takes from his pocket a curious little boxlike
instrument which he sets up on the table. He unscrews
a light bulb, screws in the plug at the end of his long
insulated wire. He has a perfectly effective electric camera.</p>

<p>One by one the essential papers of Biedermacher are
photographed, page by page, and then returned to the
files exactly—and that means <i>exactly</i>—in the place from
which each was taken. The drawers and doors are locked
again. Search has been made <i>without a search warrant</i>.
The serving of a search warrant would have “queered”
the whole case and would not have got the evidence. The
camera film has it safe.</p>

<p>“Pretty wife and kids the fellow has,” says the agent
of the building, turning over the photographs which the
simple and kindly Biedermacher, respected Board of Trade
broker, we will say, has in his desk. He turns them back
again to exactly—<i>exactly</i>—the same position.</p>

<p>“Good night, John,” he yawns to the janitor, when
they meet him on the floor below. “Pretty late, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>The three men pass out to the street and go home.
Each of them in joining the League has sworn to break<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
any social engagement to obey a call from the League
headquarters at any hour of the day or night. Perhaps
such engagements have been broken to-night by some or
all of these three men. But no one has “broken and
entered” Biedermacher’s office.</p>

<p>In Central office some data are added to a card, cross-indexed
by name and number also, and under a general
guide. Some photostats, as these pictures are called, are
put in the “case’s” envelope. Nothing happens just yet.
Biedermacher still is watched.</p>

<p>Then, one morning, an officer of the Department of Justice
finds Mr. Biedermacher in his office. He takes from
his pocket a folded paper and says, “In the name of the
United States, I demand possession of a letter dated the
12th of last month, which you wrote to von Bernstorff in
New York. I want a letter of the 15th of this month which
you wrote to von Papen in Berlin. I want your list of
the names of the United Sängerbund and German Brotherhood
in America which you brought home from the last
meeting. I want the papers showing the sums you have
received from New York and Washington for your propaganda
work here in this city. I want the letter received
by you from seven Lutheran ministers in Wisconsin telling
of their future addresses to the faithful.”</p>

<p>“But, my God!” says Biedermacher, “what do you
mean? I have no such letters here or anywhere else. I
am innocent! I am as good an American as you are. I
have bought a hundred thousand dollars’ worth of Liberty
bonds, some of each issue. My wife is in the Red Cross.
I have a daughter in Y. W. C. A. I give to all the war
charities. I am an American citizen. What do you mean
by insulting me, sir?”</p>

<p>“John,” says the officer to his drayman, “go to that
desk. Take out all the papers in it. Here’s the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span>
warrant, Mr. Biedermacher. Rope ’em up, John.”</p>

<p>John ropes up the files, and the papers go in bulk to
the office of the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> attorney on the case. Now, <i>all</i> the
evidence is in possession of the Government, and the case
is clear. Biedermacher is met quietly at the train when
he tries to get out of town. Nothing gets into the papers.
No one talks—secrecy is the oath. But before long, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
big Biedermacher offices are closed. Biedermacher’s wife
says her husband has gone south for his health. He has—to
Oglethorpe.</p>

<p>You think this case imaginary, far-fetched, impossible?
It is neither of the three. It is the truth. It shows how
D.&nbsp;J. and A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. worked together. This is a case which
has happened not once but scores and hundreds of times.
It is espionage, it is spy work, yes, and it has gone on to
an extent of which the average American citizen, loyal or
disloyal, has had no conception. It was, however, the
espionage of a national self-defense. It was only in this
way that the office and the mail and the home of the loyal
citizen <i>could</i> be held inviolate. The web of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
was precisely that of the submarine net. Invisible, it
offered an apparently frail but actually efficient defense
against the dastardly weapons of Germany.</p>

<p>It must become plain at once that secret work such as
this, carried on in such volume all across the country—three
million cases, involving an enormous mass of detail
and an untold expenditure of time and energy, were disposed
of—meant system and organization to prevent overlapping
of work and consequent waste of time. It meant
more than that—there was needed also good judgment,
individual shrewdness and of course, above all things, patience
and hard work.</p>

<p>For instance, John Wielawski is a deserter reported to
National Headquarters missing from Camp Grant, Illinois,
possibly hiding in Chicago. The order goes to the Chief
in Chicago, who hands it to the right district lieutenant.
The latter finds in his cards the name of an operative who
speaks Wielawski’s native tongue. The latter goes to the
neighborhood where Wielawski lived, inquires especially
in regard to any sweetheart or sweethearts Wielawski may
have had. It is certain he left some ties somewhere, that
he has been seen, that he has written at least a line, or
will write. His running down is sure. The League has
found thousands of deserters, located thousands of men
who had refused to take out their second naturalization
papers, thousands who were skulkers and draft evaders.
They could not escape the Web which reached all across
America, unseen, but deadly sure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>The great average intelligence of the League members
alone made the extraordinary results possible. These were
no ordinary hired sleuths of the mysterious detective type,
gum-shoe artists with a bent for masks and false eyebrows.
On the contrary, the officers and operatives were men of
standing, of great personal intelligence and sober good
sense. They dropped their private affairs, in which they
had been successful, to obey the League call at any time.
They studied their new duties regularly and faithfully,
as best they could—and they learned them.</p>

<p>The methods of such men varied widely. They had
attended no outside school, had no special governmental
training. Their success depended on the natural alertness
of the American character. For instance, one gentleman
prominent in the work, we will say in New York, was
sent after a draft evader whose name, racially considered,
did not tally with his personal description. The operative
found his case originated in a foreign part of the city. His
man had originally lived in a certain flat. Some boys
played ball near by. The operative strolled by to watch,
engaged two or three in conversation. Yes, a dark man—some
said he was a Turk—had lived there. He had
moved, they didn’t know where. He used to work in a
laundry, they thought. Very well, a Turk and a laundry-man
would naturally be found in some other laundry, possibly
near his own people. The case was carried on until,
in a laundry in another part of the same city, a new man
was found—he had a new name, but the same face.
Eventually he was put where he belonged.</p>

<p>The psalmist of old voiced his complaint that there were
three things in the world which he did not know, three
things which he could not find out: the way of a ship
upon the sea, the way of the serpent on a rock, and the
way of a man with a maid. The trouble with Solomon
was that he seems not to have owned either a geometry,
a microscope or a dictagraph. These used respectively in
connection with the problems described above might have
helped him out considerably.</p>

<p>A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operatives at Nyack, New York, had Solomon
beaten by a city block. They installed a dictagraph in a
room frequented by one A. <span class="nowrap">L——</span>, who was impersonating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
an officer, declaring that he was “Chief of the Secret
Service from New York to Boston.” His game was to
advertise for women to engage in espionage work, saying
that the Government would pay a big price and would
also buy clothes and hats for the operatives and put them
up at the best hotels. It was suspected very keenly that
Mr. A. <span class="nowrap">L——</span> was neither employed by the Government
nor acting as an officer and a gentleman ought to act. He
did not know anything about the deadly dictagraph which
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. had placed in this apartment. Hence, he conversed
quite freely with a certain Mrs. <span class="nowrap">U——</span>, who had
answered his advertisement and at whose apartment he was
paying a call. They seem first to have talked about the
apartment itself, the conversation going as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Mrs. U.</i>—: Isn’t it nice? I’m crazy about it. He is a curio
dealer, the owner of the apartment. Here is the dish closet.
Here is the kitchen. Look and see the bedroom. I haven’t
got my bed linen yet. Sit down and I’ll talk to you. Oh,
I’ve got to get rid of this hat; my head aches.</p>

<p><i>Mr. L</i>—: Oh, what a nice lamp.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. U</i>—: Isn’t it lovely? See, you can turn the lights on
here. Look, this is the telephone downstairs. There’s one
thing; they are very strict here. You have to be careful. Sit
down there.</p>

<p>(<i>Pause of a minute.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mrs. U</i>—: I can’t swallow a pill to save my life. Now,
I’ll tell you what I have to say. Do you know I like that picture?
I think it must have been a calendar. You know he
said he would buy me anything I wanted. He is some kid,
that boy. This is just like the headache I had two weeks
ago. I had such a headache. All day Sunday I was in bed
and I couldn’t get any relief. It’s just the same old way all
along. It is so trying. Now, I want to hear all about your
trip. I am terribly interested. Tell me all about it.</p>

<p><i>Mr. L</i>—: Now, tell me exactly what you told him.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. U</i>—: Sit down. Here’s what I told him.</p>

<p><i>Mr. L</i>—: What’s his name and all about him?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. U</i>—: Well, the first time I met him he told me all
about the story of his life. Then, some time after that I met
him again. “Hey, kid,” he said, “you know a lot of people in
Wall Street; take me down there and introduce me to some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
of them.” I said: “I have a friend who is very well connected.”
Well, I saw him again and I told him that I had met
you, and that you were right close to the Government and
were in touch with the Government offices and you got inside
news. Of course, I didn’t tell him that you were in the Secret
Service of the Government. You don’t want me to tell him
that, do you?</p>

<p><i>Mr. L</i>—: No, not at all. I’ll decide what I want to tell him.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. U</i>—: Do you think he could be a spy?</p>

<p><i>Mr. L</i>—: Yes, he could be. He acts just like one. He acts
like a perfect damn fool.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. U</i>—: Well, how do they act?</p>

<p><i>Mr. L</i>—: They act just this way. That’s their game.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. U</i>—: Oh, I get so excited about your work.</p>

<p><i>Mr. L</i>—: Yes; you know, if you were to catch a spy like
that, it would be worth $5,000 to you.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. U</i>—: $5000! Would it really? Who would pay that?</p>

<p><i>Mr. L</i>—: The Government.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. U</i>—: Oh, it’s so exciting! You must think me silly,
but I can’t help getting all excited about this Secret Service
work! And you’re the head of it, too, aren’t you?</p>

<p><i>Mr. L</i>—: I am not the head of it all. I am only the head
of certain branches. You know there are different branches.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. U</i>—: Which are you in?</p>

<p><i>Mr. L</i>—: In the Treasury Department.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. U</i>—: In the Treasury Department?</p>

<p><i>Mr. L</i>—: Yes, I’m the head of the Treasury Department
and three other Departments besides. Four of them altogether.
There are seventeen different branches, you know;
I have full charge of this one.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. U</i>—: No wonder you’re so busy! Well, have you
caught any spies lately?</p>

<p><i>Mr. L</i>—: Oh, yes. We get them right along. I got forty
last week.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. U</i>—: You know, we have known each other a long
time now, haven’t we? You know, it’s funny how you meet
people through advertisements. Nearly everybody that I met
in a business way I met through advertisements. And everybody
that I met that way turned out to be a factor in my life!
I met a good friend of mine, a girl, through an ad. And then,
I have got some very good positions through advertisements.
And then, I met you through that ad in—let’s see—was it the
“Times”?</p>

<p><i>Mr. L</i>—: No, the “Herald.”</p>

<p><i>Mrs. U</i>—: Tell me about that girl that you said you had
that was so good. Is she still catching spies?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p><i>Mr. L</i>—: Yes; she got fourteen last week.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. U</i>—: Gee! She must have worked overtime....
Did she have to do what you wanted me to do?</p>

<p><i>Mr. L</i>—: Oh, yes, you see she was crazy about the work.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. U</i>—: Gosh, you know that is very interesting to me.
How many girls did you get from that advertisement? I
guess you think I am a fool, but I get so interested, and I like
to have you tell me all these things.</p>

<p><i>Mr. L</i>—: Oh, I don’t remember. You know, I think the
spies would take to you and I don’t blame them. I know I
would.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. U</i>—: Do you think they would like a red-head? Is
there any demand at all for them?</p>

<p><i>Mr. L</i>—: Oh, I couldn’t see all of them.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. U</i>—: I guess you’re busy now with all these German
submarines around, aren’t you?</p>

<p><i>Mr. L</i>—: Oh, yes, indeed; very busy. They are very dangerous
people.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. U</i>—: Do you always have to teach those girls that
you have in the Secret Service? You know I have been reading
all about this spy work and this Secret Service thing since
I saw you. I am so much interested. They go by numbers,
don’t they, instead of names? Well, if I was in the service,
would you look up all about where I was born, and who my
people were, and everything like that? Would you do that to
see if I had any German blood? I’ll tell you why I ask it,
because the Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A. people told me that they would have
to look me up very carefully and that they would have to find
out if any of my people were born in Germany.... How
long have you been in the Government Secret Service?</p>

<p><i>Mr. L</i>—: Twenty-five years.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. U</i>—: Twenty-five years! Oh, dear, and no one would
ever know that you were in it.</p>

<p><i>Mr. L</i>—: Come here—oh, you’re just a little kiddie.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. U</i>—: Oh, now, wait a minute, just wait a minute!</p>
</div>

<p>The operatives who were listening to this partially
reported conversation in the janitor’s room did not wait
even a minute. They broke down the door and arrested
Mr. <span class="nowrap">L——</span>. He was turned over to the United States
Secret Service and arraigned before the Assistant District
Attorney. His activities as an employer of espionage
agents thereupon ceased abruptly. He was a cheap and
dirty imposter.</p>

<p>It was found in hundreds of cases—and the knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
was invariably suppressed—that an alien suspect’s sudden
and mysterious shifts and changes, his suspicious and
watchful conduct, his evasive acts, all had to do with nothing
more than the fact that the man had a mistress or so
in another part of the city. The woman in his case very
often was not the woman in the case at all, for there was
no case, so far as the League was concerned. But countless
men were quietly warned. Often with tears they implored
the secrecy which was given them. There are hundreds,
perhaps thousands, of men in America whose private lives
are known to the League and not known in their own
families. There is yet to be known the first case where
any advantage ever was taken of the unintended victim
caught in the general meshes of the Web; but it may be
interesting for any of those of guilty conscience who by
chance may read these lines, to know that their lives are
filed away, cross-indexed, for future reference in the vast
archives of the Department of Justice at Washington!</p>

<p>The extent of these “woman cases,” as they were known,
is very considerable, and the per cent of suspect spy cases
which simmered down to a petticoat basis is a very large
one. A great part of the work of the League was done in
finding the woman, if not in searching for her specifically.
The League brought up from the deep-sea soundings of its
steel meshes all the sordid and unworthy phases of human
life on the part of both men and women. But while combing
out the discards of human intrigue, the League often
found the evidence it really sought. This was without fail
used mercilessly and coldly.</p>

<p>One case, handled by the Central Division in Chicago,
we may call the Otero case. Word came from El Paso that
a certain prominent Mexican, a revolutionary and political
leader with aspirations for a very high office in that republic,
had come into the United States and was headed north,
probably for Chicago. Nothing was known about him and
his purpose excepting that his name was given. The
League at once began making inquiries about Senor Otero.
It was found that he was traveling in a special car. Obviously,
therefore, he was a man of money. Ergo, he would
go to a good hotel, and he probably would make a reservation
in advance. Inquiries were made by telephone at all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
the leading hotels in Chicago, which in practically all cases
were members of the American Protective League. Senor
Otero was found to have reserved a large suite at the
Blackstone, and had made the time of his arrival known.
From that time on, he was in the hands of the American
Protective League, although he never knew it. The boy
who took his bag at the door was an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operative,
the bellhop who responded to his summons was an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
operative, his waiter at table was A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L., his night taxicab
driver was A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. In fact, the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. put Senor
Otero to bed and woke him up in the morning, followed
his activities during the day and knew what he was doing
all night. It was not discovered that he was engaged in
any plot against the peace of the United States, but was
apparently active in the more pleasant task of spending
some money he had gotten hold of in Mexico. If relatives
or friends of the Senor Otero would be pleased to know
how he spent it, the nature of his associations in Chicago
by day—or night—and if they can persuade the Department
of Justice to advise them, they can find the entire
record of his stay in Chicago. Had he been engaged in
any suspicious acts against this country, his return to Mexico
might not have been so peaceful.</p>

<p>If an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. man knew the chemistry of any synthetic
or invisible ink, he would not make the secret public any
more than would M.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;D. Many devices for making and
using these inks, however, are very generally known,
although it is believed that Great Britain and France have
gone farthest in classifying and developing them. A piece
of a necktie has been taken from one German, a corner of
which, snipped off and put in a glass of water, would
make an invisible ink. A shoestring has been known to
do the same thing, a small piece of it making enough for
a letter or more. A shirt-stud has been described by a
foreign operative, which, when unscrewed and dropped
into a glass of water, would do the same thing and leave
no trace. With what chemicals were these articles treated
in order to make the ink? Ah, that is another matter.
If the author knew, he could not tell. One thing is sure,
it is not likely that the most inventive writer of “detective”
stories could imagine anything more ingenious or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
more baffling than some of these well-known methods in
use by our own men.</p>

<p>Mr. Byron R. Newton, collector at the port of New York,
gave out a curious story on the work done by the Customs
Intelligence Bureau, created as a lookout for smugglers
and others. This service was employed in searching
ships, examining baggage, looking out for explosive bombs,
invisible writing, and so forth. Mr. Newton’s story
appeared in the New York <i>Herald</i> of July 14, 1918, and
from it one incident may be taken.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Through the Boarding Officials, a passenger who arrived the
other day has furnished interesting material for the Intelligence
Bureau investigators. The passenger, who for some
time had been a resident of Germany, although an American
citizen, said he had been approached in Dresden by German
agents and asked if on his return to the United States he
would obtain military and other information of interest to
the Imperial German Intelligence Bureau. He was furnished
with a code to be used by him for forwarding information to
Germany and also with a formula for manufacturing an <i>invisible
ink</i>, and with paper to be treated by a special process
for correspondence. The passenger, in evidence of what he
stated, offered four collars to the customs officials. They appeared
to be ordinary negligee collars of cream-colored material—double,
turn-over collars, medium height, such as many
men wear with sport shirts or for informal occasions. The
passenger explained the purpose of these collars as follows:</p>

<p>“I take a soup plate and I put boiling water in it and let it
stand for about a quarter of an hour, after which I throw
away the water. The plate being warm, I place one of these
collars in it. I pour over the collar one hundred grams of
boiling water and let it stand for half an hour. Then I wring
out the collar, and the water that remains is my invisible ink.
They call it ‘pyrogram.’ It looks like water, it is not poisonous
and it can be drunk.</p>

<p>“I wash my hands, since they are wet with this ink, and
take the paper and fold it crosswise and begin the letter,
writing two fingers from the edge. I let it dry, and then take
a glass of water and put about one teaspoonful of ammonia in
it. With a piece of wadding dipped in this solution of ammonia
and water, I rub the paper both ways, and thus prepare
it on both sides. After this I place the paper in this wet condition
between blotting paper and under heavy books or a
trunk for three hours. You will not be able to recognize the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
paper any more. It looks like foreign writing paper, very
thin and glazed. I can write anything I choose on this letter
now. When they get the letter and develop it the writing
appears positively black. I head the letter ‘Dear Bob’ and
they know it is a code letter. When I am through with the
letter I use the word ‘Schluss,’ because in developing it, they
want to know if they have the entire letter, and that word
ends it up.”</p>

<p>This passenger also told the examining officials that in carrying
addresses without an address book, the German agents
usually take a bone button of an overcoat or a large button
of some sort and on the reverse side scratch the address with
a diamond, sometimes also scratching instructions which they
cannot carry in their heads. After this they treat the button
with shellac, or, as they call it in Germany, “spitituslak.”
That fills the crevices and dries rapidly. On reaching the
destination, they use pure alcohol to wash off the shellac.
They also write addresses on this paper and work them into
leather buttons.</p>
</div>

<p>Cipher and code are part of the education of certain
intelligence officers, but into a discussion of these matters
we may not go, as they are secrets of the American Government.
Our own experts were able to decipher and
decode all the secret messages bearing on the great German
plots in this country, but this was not usually A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
work. Of course, the lay reader, or more especially the
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. member, may know that a cipher means the substitution
of some symbol, or some number, or another
letter, for each letter of the alphabet. Or the real letters
may be transposed, one to stand for another, in such a way
that only the sender and receiver may understand. That
looks hard to read? Not at all. It is easier than code.
It is said that any cipher message can be unriddled in
time.</p>

<p>A code is a scheme agreed on by which the two parties
substitute certain whole words for the real words of the
message. A code message might seem wholly innocent—let
us say, just a simple comment on the weather. But
suppose “bright and fair” meant in code “The Leviathan
sailed this morning,” and suppose the <i>Leviathan</i> were a
transport carrying twelve thousand troops to France!
Unless the de-code artist is indeed an artist, he cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
know what interchange in ideas had been agreed upon
for interchanged words; and there are not twenty-six letters,
but 26,000 words which may be transposed in meaning.
The big German spy work—that is, the chain of
messages that passed between the German Embassy in
America and the Imperial Headquarters in Berlin—was
done in enciphered code. They had first been written in
German before coding, and after coding, the code was put
in cipher. None the less, we read them, and von Bernstorff,
Dr. Albert, et al., are no more on our soil.</p>

<p>This is specialized, expert work of the most delicate and
difficult sort, and is not for the average amateur. Sometimes
the latter had more enthusiasm than knowledge in
his ambition to be a real sleuth, and in such cases, perhaps
something amusing might happen, where zeal did not jump
with discretion.</p>

THE STORY OF CHICAGO</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Birthplace of the American Protective League—Center
of Enemy Alien Activities—Focus of German Propaganda
and Home of Pro-German Cults and Creeds—Story
of the League’s Work and Workers.</p>
</div>

<p>The unvarnished story of the growth and accomplishments
of this League is the greatest proof in the world
of the ability for self-government of intelligent, educated
and thinking men. The American Protective League was
made up of sober citizens who had something to protect.
It was no one man, no one set of men, no one city, which
makes it great. The real credit belongs to the unclassified
and unsegregated Little Fellow.</p>

<p>We had in this war the usual amount of self-seeking.
Our first pages abounded in pictures and praises of our
great men, born of God to do wonders in ships, supplies,
aeroplanes and armies. Some of them worked for a dollar
a year. Some of them earned that much, many a great
deal less. The scandals of this war are as great as the
scandals of any war, when you come to know the truth
about them. But there is no scandal attached to the plain,
average citizen in this war. It was he, the real democrat
and the real American, who won this war for us.</p>

<p>There is no charge of vain-glory, no charge of inefficiency
and self-seeking attached to the story of Chateau
Thierry and Belleau Wood and the Argonne, where died
thousands of Little Fellows become great in making good.
Neither is there any scandal attaching to the unknown
men, the unnamed Little Fellows who “made good” back
home behind the lines—the men who usually get lost
after any war when the glory is being passed around by
the politicians and paid historians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>There is, in a work such as this, no such thing as dividing
or apportioning personal or local credit or approbation.
Names, portraits, credits, praises—nothing of these
is desired or may be begun, for there could be no end;
and besides, one man is as big and as good as another in
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. The League existed in countless communities
all over the country—so many, it is not possible even to
name a fraction of them. There is not even the possibility
of mentioning more than a few of the greater centers of
the work, and that in partial fashion only.</p>

<p>In this plan, perhaps, the city of Chicago naturally may
come first, because, as we have seen, it was there that the
League began. Besides, in this great Western hive of all
the races, there are far more Germans than there are
Americans. Have you not heard that astounding utterance
of a sitting Mayor to the effect that Chicago is “the
sixth greatest German city on the earth”? One also has
heard an earlier Mayor of Chicago say that in his political
plans he cared nothing at all for the American vote.
“Give me the Austrian and the Italian and the Polish
vote,” he said; “but above all, give me the German vote!”
Perhaps he would not be so outspoken to-day.</p>

<p>Among the unassimilated rabble who make a certain portion
of Chicago’s polyglot politik-futter, there are perhaps
more troublemakers than in any other city of America.
It is our own fault that they make so much trouble, but
they do make it and they have. Bolsheviki, socialists,
incendiaries, I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.’s, Lutheran treason-talkers, Russellites,
Bergerites, all the other-ites, religious and social
fanatics, third-sex agitators, long haired visionaries and
work-haters from every race in the world—Chicago had
them and has them still, because she has invited them,
accepted them and made them free of the place. Cheap
politicians have done the rest; mayors who care nothing
for the American vote.</p>

<p>This was the situation when we declared war. We then
heard less about the “duty” the foreign-born had reserved
when they swore (and then forgot) their solemn Delbrücked
oaths of renunciation of all other allegiance, and
of loyalty to America alone. But underneath this smug
oath of faith to America, all too often the Teuton and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
kin, the Kaiser’s friend and sympathizer, still hid
unchanged. To-day, as thousands of them read these lines,
they know that this is the truth.</p>

<p>When we went to war, the militant Chicago Germans
did not change—they simply submerged, German fashion;
that was all. Then Chicago dropped her paravanes—spread
down her WEB—to guard against under-surface
attacks.</p>

<p>Once firmly established, the Chicago Division grew by leaps
and bounds. On March 22, 1917, the first definite steps were
taken toward the formation of a compact organization. Captains
were appointed by Mr. Briggs, and these in turn organized
their own working squads. Mr. Clabaugh was now
beginning to get some of the assistance he so sorely needed.</p>

<p>Then, on April 6, came war. Followed the days of swift
expansion and organization which have been covered in the
preceding pages. Every day saw new men enrolled, big men,
men eager to contribute time, money, experience, brains,
energy and faithfulness. This is the story of the whole
League, and this is Chicago’s story, too.</p>

<p>On April 10, Mr. Charles Daniel Frey was appointed a
captain in the Chicago Division, and shortly afterward, Mr.
Victor Elting came into the organization as an appointee of
Mr. Frey. Two months had now passed since the first Chicago
operative had gone forth on an official mission. Chicago
Division was demonstrably a success. Yet something more
was needed. Work was piling up faster than personnel. It
was now patent that Chicago must have a larger, stronger
organization—an organization under direct executive control
which would do its work with efficiency and business-like
despatch. System was needed; speed was needed—and men.
On May 22, as a first step in the reorganization, Mr. Briggs
appointed Mr. Frey as Chief of the Chicago Division and
Mr. Elting as Assistant Chief.</p>

<p>Mr. Frey and Mr. Elting thereupon developed a comprehensive
plan of organization for the Chicago Division—a
plan which was adopted in its main outlines by almost all of
the large cities. Chicago was divided into zones, and an
Inspector was appointed to direct and supervise the work
in each zone. Bureaus were established covering the whole
range of League operations. Bankers, railroad men, merchants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
professional men—leading men from every sphere
of activity were placed in charge of bureau work for which
they were especially fitted.</p>

<p>The League was now a going concern in Chicago. That
it should become national in every sense of the word was
inevitable. In October, 1917, Mr. Frey and Mr. Elting joined
Mr. Briggs in Washington and, in conference with the Attorney
General of the United States, it was decided to establish
National Headquarters in the Capital. The three men who
were responsible for this great step became the national
directors of the League. Pending the appointment of a
Chief and Assistant Chief for the Chicago Division, Mr. R. A.
Gunn, who had made a most efficient record as an Inspector,
was appointed Acting Chief.</p>

<p>On January 26, 1918, Mr. John F. Gilchrist was appointed
Chief of the Chicago Division, a position which he continued
to hold until September 21, 1918, six weeks before the
Armistice. Under his wise leadership, the organization
gained in strength and numbers and influence, and handled,
in wholly admirable fashion, the many difficult problems
which arose during nine of the most trying months of the
war. The Chicago unit, at the close of 1917, numbered 4,500
active members and about 2,000 industrial members. At the
time of the Armistice, these numbers had been increased to
6,142 active members and over 7,000 members in the industrial
division.</p>

<p>Upon the resignation of Mr. Gilchrist, a committee plan
of executive control was adopted, and Mr. R. A. Gunn was
appointed Chief. Mr. Gunn’s report to D.&nbsp;J., covering the
work of the Chicago Division almost to the period of the
Armistice, will give at least a partial notion of what was
accomplished, and should, therefore, be summarized:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The greater part of the work of the organization is, of
course, the work assigned from the Bureau of Investigation,
with such complaints as are received from our own members,
both active and industrial, and a number that come through
the mail. We receive an average of 175 D.&nbsp;J. cases daily.
Our reports when turned in are vised by the Chief of our
Bureau of Investigation, and those deemed ready for prosecution
are turned over to the Special Agent assigned, and by
him are taken to the District Attorney for active prosecution.
I believe that our co-operation with the Bureau has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
active and I think, helpful, at all times. We have furnished
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. men used for special work, such as under-cover investigations
in the County Jail and in the Internment Camps.
Through our organization, which covers practically every banking
institution, mercantile, industrial and manufacturing
plant, every profession and trade, in the entire Chicago district,
we have furnished special and specific information from
among our own members, which the Bureau of Investigation
has generously intimated could hardly have been secured from
any other source.</p>

<p>At its own expense, A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. furnished three competent
stenographers for a period of three months to systematize,
card and index the 18,000 male German alien enemies, registered
by the United States Marshal. During the “drives” of
the Red Cross, many rumors and derogatory statements concerning
the work of the Red Cross were spread broadcast
through the country. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. ran down hundreds of complaints,
secured many convictions, and handled the entire
investigation of the Red Cross until quite recently, when they
added a Bureau of Investigation of their own. The propaganda
has practically ceased.</p>

<p>Work in co-operation with the Local Fuel Administrator
was always active. Beginning with the fuelless Mondays, A.
P. L. placed at his disposal some 3,500 men for checking up
violations. On the lightless Monday and Tuesday night, A.
P. L. had out the entire active organization checking violations
of this sort. Again, on the order of the Administrator
that no gasoline should be used on Sundays for pleasure, the
entire organization was called on for service. During the
wheatless and meatless days, also, the entire organization
was called on to check and report violations among the restaurants,
hotels and other places.</p>

<p>Chicago received daily from M.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;D. at Washington an average
of twenty-five cases for character and loyalty investigations
of civilians and officers going into foreign service. This work
alone required the services of a Bureau Chief and five clerical
assistants at headquarters.</p>

<p>Following the bomb explosion at the Federal building (where,
by the way, A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. mobilized within half an hour 1,700 men
for duty if called upon), the officials of the United States War
Exposition called on the organization for help. For eight
days, an average of two hundred and fifty A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. men
mingled with the crowd both afternoon and evening with a
view of preventing panics and of detecting and forestalling
any outrage.</p>

<p>Next in volume to the work from D.&nbsp;J. was that which came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
in under the Selective Service Act in connection with the draft
problem. In addition to the locating of registrants, the division,
on request, conducted investigations on a number of
Local Boards, and also investigated thousands of cases involving
deferred classifications, where the result of the investigation
placed the registrant in Class 1-A and made him
available for immediate service.</p>

<p>At the specific request of the commanding officer of the
local branch of the Ordnance Department, Chicago division
conducted a total of 536 investigations of officers and employees
of the Ordnance Department in Chicago. Similar
work was done for the Bureau of Investigation.</p>
</div>

<p>Chief Gunn concludes his simple and convincing narrative
with a few division figures:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In conclusion I would say that at the headquarters of our
units we employed sixty-six stenographers and clerks who were
directed by thirty-one able men who gave their entire time,
days, nights, and often Sundays, without one penny from our
Treasury, to the direction of this work. In addition to this, we
maintained eighteen captain’s offices, the average monthly expenditure
of each being in the neighborhood of $300. Exclusive
of this, our average monthly expenses were about $7,000,
which money was raised both from our own membership and
from subscriptions of individuals and commercial houses.</p>

<p>We have been insistent at all times that our men should
set a patriotic example to all others in accepting active service
when liable or able. This is evidenced by the fact that
five hundred and fifty of our members are now in the service.
I have no hesitancy in saying that for loyalty, ability,
judgment, and willingness to serve their country, I do not
know, nor do I believe there can exist, a more splendid body
of men than is contained in the membership of our Division of
the American Protective League.</p>
</div>

<p>Follows the statistical record of the work accomplished
by the Chicago division of the American Protective League
up to January 21, 1919:</p>

<p class="p2">But it is from the notebooks of the operatives, recording
varied activities all in the day’s work, that we get the
real reflex of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. We cannot forego giving a
few extracts from the stories of Chicago captains.</p>

<p>Let us take at random the summary from <span class="nowrap">S——</span>, captain
of District No. 11, where there were fifty-six members—forty
active operatives, under a captain, two lieutenants
and a legal advisor. This district covers a large portion
of the most German section of Chicago, part of which is
loyal and part very much otherwise. In six months, during
the last year of the war, there were 512 cases assigned
to the district by headquarters, and the district turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
in to headquarters 298 complaints. Character and loyalty
investigations to the number of fifty-three were made,
necessitating from five to fifteen interviews each. In the
slacker drive, July 11-13, a total of 1,744 individual cases
were interviewed and disposed of in this district. Between
9:00 p. m. and 4:00 a. m. one night, eighty-one I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.
investigations were handled.</p>

<p>The total number of cases on record in this district for
the six months is 3,842, which, if averaged, gives sixty-eight
cases to each operative, but as only forty were active,
the average should be figured as nearly eighty cases per
capita. There is not figured in the foregoing about one
thousand interviews which were necessary in making up
reports to different departments of the Government on
factories, saloons, garages and other buildings and structures,
which might come under the head of miscellaneous
services.</p>

<p>The activities of the operatives of District No. 11 were
not confined to the boundaries of their own district. An
illustration will show what is meant. A deserter was being
protected by all branches of his family. Operatives spent
nights interviewing every ascertainable relative and friend.
Nothing could be learned except that the various members
of the family, male and female, were so mixed in their sex
relations that apparently no two of the opposite sex were
living together in a legally permissible way. A chance
lead pointed to a couple living in the country ten miles
beyond the city limits. An hour’s interview with the man
and his consort, the two being examined separately,
resulted in the chance mention of Norfolk, Virginia. Being
pressed on this remark, the man hesitatingly declared he
had had letters from Norfolk from the suspect who was
working there and that he, the witness, would himself
write to Norfolk at once and get definite information.
The operatives agreed cheerfully to the proposition. On
their return to the city, a telegram was immediately dispatched
to Norfolk. By the time the letter from the
“loyal” relative reached Norfolk, word was received that
the deserter was located and taken into custody. The
action of this little drama was staged entirely outside of
District No. 11.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>During the “heatless days” two operatives from the
same district entered a saloon. They found it warm, the
heat coming from a large radiator in the middle of the
room covered by a table. The proprietor claimed he was
unable to shut off this heat without shutting off the heat
from rooms above where he had lodgers. The operatives
went to the cellar and found no attempt had been made
to shut off the heat from the saloon. Returning to the
saloon, they investigated a back room, which was also
heated, and where they found four men playing cards.
The proprietor claimed these men were his lodgers and
that this was their sitting-room. A search was made and
evidence found which proved these men to be conducting
a regular clearing-house of information for the enemy’s
use. Leads were discovered that spread in many directions
and made the case one of the most important handled
by the District. A camouflaged saloon radiator was the
starting point.</p>

<p>Each operative discovered that the badge he wore bred
a feeling of respect or fear for the authority of Uncle
Sam which was quite marked. Seldom was an attempt
made to dispute its meaning or to take exception to the
request or direction made under its authority. The most
desperate characters showed a meekness and a docility
that was surprising. The only explanation reasonable is
that the United States has from the start of the war shown
the world and its own people that it meant business, and
that in playing with the authorized agencies of the Government,
criminals were not playing with politicians or
officials who might be influenced, but with the newly and
sternly roused sense of American loyalty which would
brook no traitor or near-traitor under the Star and Stripes.</p>

<p>District No. 13 had an interesting case handled by Lieutenant
McR—— and Operative <span class="nowrap">L——</span>. They searched
the room occupied by the suspect and found two handbags
and several suit-cases filled with clothing and some chemicals.
They interviewed the subject. His registration card
gave his serial and order number, and draft board status
which was Class No. 5 Austrian. The operatives went back
to report this to the Inspector, and upon returning found
that the subject, his wife and sister had fled. By calling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
upon the different taxicab companies in the neighborhood,
it was found that they had used a yellow taxicab to move
their effects to an apartment several miles distant. A raid
was immediately organized. Four men and two detective
sergeants went to the new address, and the apartment was
surrounded. One of the men saw a figure which appeared
to be a woman, attempting to cross the area between the
two buildings from one third story window to another,
and he called to her to stop. One of the men inside the
building, hearing the call, put his head out and found
the subject on the window sill of the adjoining building
in a very embarrassing position. It was not a woman,
but the suspect, in woman’s clothes! He was hauled in
and put under arrest. In the meantime an analysis of
the chemicals had been made and they were found to consist
of materials for the manufacture of enough explosives
to blow out another end of the postoffice building. Information
was received from the League at New York to the
effect that he was a very dangerous enemy alien.</p>

<p>This same District landed another good case. One morning
a traveling man heard a little girl say to a small boy
playmate, “We have a fine piano in our flat,” and the
boy finally answered, “That’s nothing, we’ve got a German
spy in ours.” The traveling man turned a complaint
in to the Department of Justice and in due course it came
back to our district to be investigated. The operative had
little to start with. Finally he asked a little girl if she
had ever heard any boy make such a remark. By merest
chance, she happened to be one of the children who had
overheard the boy, and at once pointed out where he lived.
The operative then went to the apartment and questioned
the boy’s mother, telling her that he was getting a list of
boarding-houses in that district for directory purposes and,
of course, asking her the names and occupations of all
lodgers. He noticed that one of the names was German
and after he had finished his list he asked her if he might
see the accommodations. When he reached the German’s
room, he saw a trunk of foreign make. He opened it and
found lying inside on top of the clothing a cartridge belt
filled with loaded cartridges. This he noticed had seen
much use and was worn smooth. He also found papers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
drawings, a Lueger pistol and several other things which
an alien enemy is not supposed to enjoy during war times.
The landlady stated that the man was a draftsman in the
Federal Building. It was subsequently found that the
drawings were plans of the Municipal Pier and the Federal
Building. About five o’clock the next morning, several
Federal officers took the man down to the Bureau of
Investigation and found that he was an enemy alien in
the employ of the German Government. Within twenty-four
hours he was on his way to Leavenworth under an
order of internment.</p>

<p>Women are not enlisted in espionage work for M.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;D.
and were not employed as operatives in the Chicago A. P.
L.—with one exception. Many a suspect has found “Mrs.
B” fatally easy to look at and listen to—even easy to
talk too much to!</p>

<p>Here is a “Mrs. B” case. The subject, Miss <span class="nowrap">W——</span>,
during the year 1912, met a Mr. and Mrs. <span class="nowrap">M——</span>, Americans,
who were in Paris with their two children, a boy
ten and a girl twelve. Miss <span class="nowrap">W——</span> told them a story
of having quarreled with her family, who were quite
wealthy, and said she was seeking a position that would
bring her to America. She produced unquestionable references,
and returned with the <span class="nowrap">M——</span> family to the
United States. After remaining in their employ for six
months, she took a course in nursing in <span class="nowrap">B——</span> Hospital
in Indianapolis. She graduated from this hospital, came
to Chicago with letters of introduction from the faculty,
and became engaged here as governess in the home of a
wealthy family on Lake Shore Drive. In April, 1917, she
applied to the Chicago Telephone Company for a position,
asking to be sent to France in their next unit. She told
a confusing story in reference to her age, brought about
a suspicion, which was followed by an investigation.
“Mrs. B.” was given the assignment. Miss <span class="nowrap">W——</span> gave
up her position as governess, took a room on the north
side of Chicago near Wilson Avenue. She was closely
shadowed night and day, and was found to be in continual
communication with doctors and nurses. During the time
she was waiting to hear from the Chicago Telephone Company
in reference to the application she had filed, she also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
filed an application with the American Red Cross. Here
she gave practically the same references, and told the
same story. Investigators from the American Red Cross
were advised by the Department of Justice that they drop
their investigation for the time being. “Mrs. B” proved
that this woman was the medium through which tetanus
germs were being delivered to certain doctors and nurses,
who in turn were to spread them through our cantonments
and hospitals.</p>

<p>District No. 8 lies in the extreme southern part of Chicago.
“The Gold Coast” of this territory, lying along
“The Ridge,” is a strictly residential district, but a
veritable melting-pot of foreigners has sprung up in the
neighborhood of the mammoth factories and mills in the
suburban towns of Kensington, West Pullman, Roseland,
Riverdale and South Chicago proper, east of the Southern
Division Gold Coast. In this modern Babel there are fifty
or sixty different nationalities. Even a short season with
such a racial hodge-podge as exists in and around Kensington
is almost equivalent to a trip around the world.
Practically the only work in this community (Districts
41 and 47) consisted of draft evasions and pro-Germans.
The last named were kindly but positively reminded that
our country was at war. The operatives in this Gold
Coast district were practically all business men, being
recruited from banks, business houses, schools and the
ministry. It was no uncommon thing to have two ministers,
one of them a leading “dry exponent,” go out
with a squad of men through saloons and pool-rooms,
picking up suspects and evaders. During the four-day
raid in July, one of the captains working out of Draft
Board No. 22 remarked: “I just sent out the vice-president
of our bank. I commanded him to look up one of
these draft cases and he went right to it without question.
That man holds the mortgage on my home, and I am bossing
him around as though he were my office boy!”</p>

<p>Another captain tells something more of this foreign
part of the city, Districts 39, 40, 42, 46 of the South Division.
This comprises the large territory on the lake, at
the extreme southern end of the city, and has in it a large
harbor and river which is lined with elevators, shipyards,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
and important steel industries of all kinds. The population
is mostly of foreign origin, anything from a descendant
of the Pilgrim Fathers to a Tartar from Siberia. Poles,
Austrians, Serbs, Swedes, Germans and Italians predominate,
and many of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operatives were recruited
from this source, thereby giving access to all tongues. This
division captain says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The magnitude of the shipping and the enormous steel industries,
together with a population of from ten to twenty
thousand aliens, has rightly given this district the reputation
of being one of the most difficult in Chicago. Thousands of
these people speak no English, and are living here under foreign
customs. Two local draft boards are in this district, 19
and 20, and naturally many cases of draft evasion were found.
After the first general registration, we were called upon to investigate
about 1,200 cases under this head, a large percentage
of them being cases of men who were really willing to comply
with the regulations, but who had been badly advised by their
more erudite countrymen. As we always have a large “floating
population,” we naturally experienced much trouble in
tracing this class.</p>

<p>That small things often lead to large affairs, we discovered
many times. One night a Pole came home, went over to the
side of the room, took a large crucifix from the wall, broke it
across his knee, and told his wife who stared at him big-eyed
with horror, that that —— thing was no good any more
and that he had no place for it. The woman, who like most
of her nationality, was intensely religious, was quick to see
that her man was not drunk, and was shrewd enough to determine
to find the cause of his action. On quizzing him, she
found he had joined a new Polish Church which taught many
new things, so she asked if she could not go to that church.
He took her there, and she learned of the notorious Pastor
Russell and his teachings, heard the doctrines of non-resistance
preached, and learned of a service to be held to persuade young
men never to fight or shed blood under any circumstances.
She reported what she learned, and made such a positive and
specific affidavit, that we resolved to see how much truth it
contained. So, when we discovered that services were being
held in their church, and that the congregation contained a
great many young men of draft age, evidently Poles, we took
a chance and called the wagon.</p>

<p>We arrested the entire congregation during the services,
confiscated copies of “The Finished Mystery,” a proscribed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
book, and practically moved the contents of the church to the
police station. Here we found much seditious literature, and
obtained statements from many of the congregation, which
were sufficient to cause quite a stir. At present, seven of the
leaders of this church from Brooklyn are sojourning at Fort
Leavenworth. We feel, here in southern Chicago, that the
breaking of that crucifix led to a nation-wide investigation
of a dangerous propaganda.</p>
</div>

<p>This same captain, in closing his report, makes the following
observation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Some of the striking phases of this work are the real friendships
engendered by our associations with each other. Here
the measure of a man is his loyalty and sincerity, his judgment,
his grit, and his personal sacrifice. When you can find
as many real and true Americans as this organization contains,
you need never have worries as to whether this country
is going to be safe.</p>
</div>

<p>Central District of Chicago is that important region covering
the great business district, out of which some four
hundred men, under four captains, regularly worked all
over the city. This is not one of the residence districts,
so that the squad of operatives who reported to this
branch were far scattered throughout the city for most of
the twenty-four hours. The personnel of this district
embraced lawyers, doctors, bankers, printers, dry goods
merchants, insurance men, mechanics, railway trainmen,
traveling salesmen, actors, and all kinds of employed persons.
A great many members belonged to the prominent
clubs of Chicago. There were interpreters who understood
all of the continental languages. There were both rich
men and poor men included in this membership. There
were boys in the twenties and men of sixty-five. It had
come to be the practice of all the interlocking branches of
our Governmental defensive organizations to call up Central
District for men needed on some particular work. It
had been the headquarters squad, and had sent men all
over Northern Illinois, and sometimes out of the State.</p>

<p>There was a school of instruction for new operatives in
this district in which new men are taught the elements
of the League work, the elements of espionage laws, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
other war measures. They were instructed, also, in the
fundamentals of shadow work; the details of the selective
service regulations; the principles of law and evidence, and
other subjects proper to the activities of the League.
There were seven words taught to every operative, applying
equally well to complaints and to reports—guide
words in investigations. If these seven words were borne
in mind at the time of making complaint or investigations,
or in writing up the report, an operative would be fairly
well assured of embodying the information desired. These
words are: “Who,” “Which,” “What,” “Why,”
“When,” “How,” and “Witnesses.”</p>

<p>Every care was exercised by the operative not to
approach the subject himself or to allow him to know
he was being investigated. There were countless Chicago
Germans and pro-Germans investigated, ticketed, tabulated,
and filed away, who to this day do not know that
they ever told anybody anything about themselves. Many
of these Prussianized Chicagoans to-day wear heavy frowns
and look aggrieved.</p>

<p>In order to save his time, each operative was taught
how to use the regular city channels of information. If
he got a name without any address, he was taught to go
to the nearest telephone directory or city directory. Sometimes
a telephone number was known and the name of the
party unknown. Reference to the numerical telephone
directory sometimes covered this. Sometimes the business
of the subject might be known and his address unknown,
in which case it might be found by reference to the classified
business telephone directory, or the city directory. A
subject might be doing business in the city and living in
the suburbs. Countless suburban telephone directories were
always in the central office for such reference.</p>

<p>In every great city a directory gives a concise arrangement
of the personnel of the various departments of the
U. S. Government; state and federal officials, their titles,
their room numbers, their buildings, can be found in this
way. In this way, also, all the officers of the city government
can be found; the rooms where the court of this or
that judge are located, etc. The state offices, including
hospitals, etc., can be found in these directories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>A wide range of useful information concerning the city
and its environs was given to novitiate operatives in this
Central District. This information was of incalculable
benefit to new members of the League when once their
active investigating work began. The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. training
school was a very important cog in the Chicago machine,
and made it possible for the district to do more work per
capita and better work than would otherwise have been
possible. Indeed, the training for an operative was not
bad training for a newspaper reporter. What is said
regarding this work in the Chicago district might apply
in very considerable part also to the work in other large
communities.</p>

<p>Operatives were obliged to take all sorts of roles. At
times they acted as waiters or clerks, and sometimes they
impersonated lawbreakers themselves. One of them succeeded
in impersonating an I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. so well that at a
meeting he was covering he was asked to contribute to
the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. cause—and did so! Another ingratiated
himself into the good offices of the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.’s so well that
he was permitted to take notes at one of their meetings
with the understanding that he was a newspaper man
representing one of their own papers.</p>

<p>The Southwest Division in Chicago is only another corner
of darkest Europe. In this section, however, were
located a good many foreign-born operatives, who affiliated
well in that region and did their work thoroughly until
the closing days of the war. Their grist included some
curious and interesting cases.</p>

<p>There was, for instance, a certain person called Panco,
the Fry Cook, long wanted by the Department of Justice
for anarchistic and seditious utterances. The Department
had been hunting Panco for months but could not find
him. Four Southwest A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operatives went after Panco.
Two of them became members in a waiters’ union in which
Panco was known to belong. They could not find their
man, who did not seem to report often at the headquarters
of that union; so they gave out reports everywhere that
Panco was a dead beat and would not pay his union dues!
This came to Panco’s ears. He showed up at headquarters
to deny this impeachment. He got thirty years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>A Lithuanian lecturer was described as about to deliver
a seditious harangue in the village of Cicero, near Chicago.
The Southwest Division sent out several motor cars with
picked men ready for trouble. They found a hall crowded
with foreigners who were listening to a much bewhiskered
man, clad in shabby tweeds, who was demonstrating at a
blackboard on a platform, and was speaking in some
unknown tongue. At last one of the operatives who had
been taken along as an interpreter began to laugh and
said, “Let’s go home, fellows; we’ve got the old bird
wrong. He ain’t talking anarchy; he’s giving a lecture on
sex control!”</p>

<p>An unusual amount of shrewdness should be credited
to some of these operatives. It was a mere guess, for
instance, on the part of such a man that the figure “8”—the
final figure on a foreign birth certificate—had been
changed to a “5”. If this were true, it meant that the
suspect would come within the draft age, although otherwise
his story was perfectly straight. Suspicion is not
evidence, so the Department of Justice was about to release
this man. The latter had remarked to someone that his
father lived in Indiana. The operative went to the phone
and pretended to call up the father in this town personally,
with the intention of inducing the suspect to eavesdrop
on the phone conversation in the next room. After a
while the operative turned to the suspect, his hand over
the receiver, and said: “Well, we’ve got the information
we wanted. What have you got to say?” Completely
fooled, the suspect confessed! He was inducted into the
army.</p>

<p>A certain colored draft dodger was discovered to belong
to a staff of colored waiters in a certain hotel. The head
waiter, very pompous and very shiny, refused to allow a
search. The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. declared that if the suspect was not
forthcoming he would arrest every waiter in the place and
carry them off in the wagon. This brought out the suspect.
He’s in the Army now.</p>

<p>A certain Mrs. <span class="nowrap">L——</span> called the Red Cross a bunch of
grafters and crooks, said Ambassador Gerard was a traitor
and a liar, said the President was the greatest traitor since
Jefferson Davis and made other interesting remarks. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
repeated these statements before a <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Marshal and was
held in $5,000 bond. Then she became more abusive and
was held in $5,000 additional. She kept on until her bond
amounted to $25,000, and was then asked if she did not
think it was time to stop talking. She did. As she could
not raise the bail, she was sent to Cook County jail, where
she remained till the Armistice was signed.</p>

<p>Chicago at times handled other live stock than that
commonly seen in the stockyards. On August 5, 1918,
the sixth enemy alien special to Fort Oglethorpe carried
fifteen persons for internment. The train was to pick up
eight more at Indianapolis. On the following day, it seems,
the Chicago Symphony Orchestra had seven members who
groaned while they were playing the Star Spangled Banner.
They explained their frame of mind before a judge,
who taught them very much better manners. On August
7, Lieutenant Friederick Walter <span class="nowrap">S——</span> of the German
army, who for a month had worn a United States uniform
at Camp Grant, had his naturalization papers revoked, and
got interned for the period of the war. On September 1,
among ten aliens shipped to Fort Oglethorpe, one was a
munition manufacturer who had been just at the point of
receiving a very fat United States order. He had been
filling contracts for Germany before we went to war.</p>

<p>On November 17, 1918, the radicals and socialists of
Chicago held a great meeting in the Coliseum. There
were about 12,000 present. It is not necessary to go into
details regarding their action beyond saying that they gave
over the Chicago Socialist party, body and breeches, to
Bolshevism. Here in Chicago, one of our centers of the
civilization of America, these men declared themselves in
sympathy with Russian anarchy. In America, the land of
hope, they declared themselves in sympathy with hopelessness,
despair and destruction. Some of the speeches
were made in the German language—a tongue which we
ought to forbid to be used in public, on our streets, in our
printed pages, and over our telephone wires to-day. These
speakers, in the Hun tongue, openly deplored contributions
to our War funds. They hailed with much applause
such speakers as Victor Berger, who publicly gloried in
the four indictments pending over him. In short, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
meeting came dangerously close to being disloyal. We
shall be so mild as this in comment, since being a member
of the Socialist party is not <i>per se</i> a disloyal act, and not
all Socialists are of the radical wing.</p>

<p>Much pleased with the sound of their own voices, these
gentlemen now concluded to hold a public street parade,
with red banners and the usual Bolshevist appurtenances.
They went to Acting Chief of Police Alcock, and asked for
a permit to parade in the streets. They said they wanted
to carry the red flag, and they asked police protection.
Note the reply the Chief of Police made to them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My friends, I won’t give you police protection at all, nor
try to do so. Do you know what you are up against? There
are 12,000 A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. men in this village who are opposed to this
sort of thing, and my men don’t want to get in wrong with
any 12,000 A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. men. We work with those people and not
against them. They work with us and not against us. Believe
me, the best thing you folks can do is to cut out the
parade.</p>
</div>

<p>The representatives of the proposed parade could not
get back to their headquarters fast enough. They cut out
the parade.</p>

<p>As late as November 21, Chicago was still running enemy
alien specials for Fort Oglethorpe. This consignment
included a cook, also a Highland Park riding master who
had been over-curious in regard to matters adjacent to
Fort Sheridan. Twenty others were to be picked up later
down the line—all after the Armistice had been signed.</p>

<p>On November 23, Fred <span class="nowrap">I——</span>, said to resemble the
Crown Prince very much in his personal appearance, was
fined five thousand dollars, whether for seditious utterances
or for his resemblance to the Crown Prince does not
appear, and is immaterial. Either would be enough.</p>

<p>On November 26, nine men were given free transportation
from Chicago to Fort Leavenworth. One of these was
a Dunkard preacher who got ten years for saying, “I’d
kill a man rather than buy a Liberty bond.” He will have
time to think that proposition over.</p>

<p>These straws will show well which way the wind blew
in Chicago for the last year or so. Much to the disappointment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
of the Kaiser and one or two mayors, Chicago
seems to be but very imperfectly Germanized after all.
As for setting down the full tale of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. activities
in this city, it would be a thing impossible of accomplishment.
The world knows how Chicago does the things she
considers proper to have done. The American Protective
League in Chicago worked in the well-known and well-accredited
Chicago way. To thank the men who did this
work, or even to mention their names, would cheapen them
and their work. They did not ask thanks. They were
Americans and were citizens.</p>

THE STORY OF NEW YORK</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Focus of German International Espionage—Center
of Foreign Population—The Great Plots—Governmental
Concentration—How the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. Web Helped Collect
Traitors—Details of the Organization—A Metropolis
Loved by a Country.</p>
</div>

<p>The great American metropolis was the storm-center of
America in the war. The heart of the great and intricate
system of German espionage, the controlling financial body
of Germany’s spy army, was there; the treacherous diplomacy
of Germany centered there. Moreover, our shipments
of men, munitions and supplies largely centered there, and
that was the general point of departure of our troops bound
overseas. Naturally, therefore, our Government concentrated
in and around this danger spot its strongest protective
measures for our troops and their supplies. Literally,
it was plot and counterplot in New York; war and
counter war; espionage and counter espionage.</p>

<p>Such a story as that cannot be covered by the printed
page. No volume can describe New York’s part in the
war, for that man does not live who knows or ever will
know all that went on in New York in war time. New
York herself never will know how she was endangered
and how she was protected.</p>

<p>Until war broke out, New York was much like London.
Grown indifferent to her vast foreign element, she was
disposed to let these people meet and march, preach and
pray and then go home again, red flag and all. No great
world city can have a homogeneous population, nor can
any such population be governed as a whole. New York
accepted the fact that she was one of the centers of the
world’s transient life. Her entire business prosperity is
built up on the transient trade. With an amused indifference,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
New York allowed her visitors to meet and march,
preach and pray, amuse themselves so long as they liked,
so long as they paid for their privilege of passing through.
She had long since ceased to analyze her population, but
has entertained it instead, regarding it with neither fear,
shame, pride nor alarm. She was truly a metropolis.</p>

<p>But when war came, New York realized that she was
not only a metropolis but a commercial center and a place
where human beings lived. She had tall buildings. A
brick shot off the top of the Woolworth Building would
certainly jar a man below if it fell upon him; and the
Woolworth or other buildings might easily be hit by naval
guns of a hostile fleet lying comfortably off shore. The
funk of New York and other eastern cities was never felt
at all in the central portion of the country. When the
submarines began to show what they could do, New York
awoke to a sense of real danger. She faced the fact that,
although she was foreign in population, she must become
American if America was to endure. Then New York
turned her face no longer toward Europe, but toward
America and since that time has been more beloved by
America than ever she was before.</p>

<p>It was imperative that the vast protective agencies of
the national Government should focus here at the gateway
to the Atlantic. Military Intelligence, Naval Intelligence,
Cable Censorship, Mail Censorship, the Department of Justice,
War Trade Intelligence—each of these and all the
various war boards and branches of war activities must
center in the metropolis inevitably. The machinery for
protecting the invaluable shipping of men and munitions
was as elaborate and perfect as the Government could
make it. Every force was rushed to the danger line in
New York.</p>

<p>In so complicated and overburdened a series of Government
enterprises it early became obvious that there was
need for an auxiliary such as the American Protective
League. The organization was duly made and widely
extended. It was natural none the less that it should be
very much overshadowed by the greater volume and
greater importance of the agencies of the Government’s
judicial and war work, which were massed in the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
city. But the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. was there, active as elsewhere, and
perhaps more useful than in any other city in the country,
because it had to do there with larger risks than offered in
any other city.</p>

<p>In the period of its work in New York up to the time
of the Armistice, the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. division was thought to
have covered some 300,000 cases in all, which is far and
away the record for America. Such figures as these mean,
of course, that to single out any one case or a few cases
would be only to repeat cases the like of which already
have been described for other points; and besides, it would
not in any sense give an idea of the extent of the data
handed over to the United States departments on A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
initiative or on government request. It seems wiser to let
the great national or international cases, which have become
publicly prominent through Government activity,
stand for the minor story of New York.</p>

<p>These <i>causes celébrès</i> have in great part been made public
in the newspapers,—and in a great many instances made
yet more public by the testimony of the witnesses of the
Federal Attorneys before the Overman Senate Committee
in Washington. It certainly could be said of the great
city that she produced more sensations in espionage than
all the rest of the country combined. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. was not concerned
in all these matters, although in some of them it
played its part.</p>

<p>The first chief of the New York Division was a lawyer,
John H. Hendrick, who had charge of the small beginnings
in April, 1917, but who in the following month, was succeeded
by Richmond Levering, special agent of the Department
of Justice. Mr. Bielaski, Chief of the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Bureau
of Investigation, approved this appointment, Mr. Levering
later becoming Major in the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Army. In early June,
Mr. E. S. Underhill, an Agent of the Department of Justice,
was detailed to take charge. The work now began
to grow somewhat. In October, 1917, League affairs were
placed in the hands of an operating committee. On January
3, 1918, the committee was abolished, and Mr. E. H.
Rushmore was appointed Acting Chief. In May, 1918, Mr.
Rushmore became Chief of the Division.</p>

<p>New York Division, like others, at first was organized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
along trade lines, which was found to be impracticable.
Then the Southern and Eastern Federal Districts of New
York were divided into zones. The Borough of Manhattan
contained eight zones, each under an inspector. The Borough
of the Bronx was placed in charge of a deputy chief,
and was divided into nine sub-divisions. The Borough of
Brooklyn and Long Island was also in charge of a deputy
chief, and subdivided into eight districts, each in charge
of an inspector. The outlying districts were formed into
zones, using county lines as boundaries, and each of these
zones also was under the charge of an inspector. All the
inspectors appointed a sufficient number of captains, who
had under them lieutenants in charge of squads.</p>

<p>It will be seen that this is rather a complicated organization,
and indeed it could not be swung as a unit in the
matter of its records, because of the diverse reporting system
required.</p>

<p>The work of the Division Headquarters on Nassau Street
was efficiently handled by twenty volunteer members who
acted as Bureau Chiefs in the matter of assignment of work.
Headquarters had about fifty file clerks and stenographers
in its force, and in addition operated six zone offices,
all of which were used exclusively for these zone workers,
and all of them fully equipped with office facilities and
help. The Division expended something over $75,000, all
of which was raised by individual subscriptions of members
of the League and their friends.</p>

<p>A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in New York had all sorts of cases. Chief Rushmore
thinks about the most important was that concerned
with A. <span class="nowrap">L——</span>, intimate friend of Jeremiah O’Leary, on
trial for treason. This case was turned over to the League
by Division Superintendent DeWoody of D.&nbsp;J., who asked
the covering of all railroad stations, ferries and steamship
lines or other possible means of entry into New York in
order that <span class="nowrap">L——</span> might be apprehended. A rather
meagre description of the suspect was given. Information
had reached the Department that <span class="nowrap">L——</span> had left New
York when O’Leary forfeited his trial bond and did not
appear in court for trial on charge of treason. <span class="nowrap">L——</span>
was thought to be on his way back to New York. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
put out about one hundred operatives on this case, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
stopped hundreds of passengers who might have resembled
him and asked them to identify themselves. This came to
nothing. Other operatives interviewed the man’s wife and
were convinced <span class="nowrap">L——</span> was in town. An operative of
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L., accompanied by a D.&nbsp;J. man, therefore shadowed
one of <span class="nowrap">L——</span>’s intimate friends, with the result that
L—— himself finally was located in Brooklyn and apprehended.
He was taken to the New York office of the Department
of Justice and there gave information as to
O’Leary’s whereabouts. The latter man, who had jumped
his bail bond, was immediately apprehended in the West
and brought on to New York, where, at the last writing,
he was waiting trial on the charge of treason.</p>

<p>The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. shadow work in the foregoing case was so
good as to elicit a letter of praise from D.&nbsp;J. in Washington
to Mr. DeWoody. The latter disclaimed the credit and
gave it to the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operative “who performed a remarkable
feat in a continued and difficult shadow.”</p>

<p>The Division Chief himself writes something regarding
a matter which has brought up considerable other writing
at different times from many different sources.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The story of the much discussed slacker raid in New York
is known to every one, but we might give some details. In
August, 1918, Mr. Bielaski, in Washington, advised the National
Directors of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. that he was anxious to conduct a
New York slacker raid similar to that in Chicago. The National
Directors conferred with Mr. De Woody, the D.&nbsp;J. Agent
in New York, who talked the matter over with Martin Conboy,
Director of the Draft for New York City. The National Directors
also went to the New York Division of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. and
left a tentative plan based upon the Chicago arrangement,
which was submitted to Mr. DeWoody, who, later, with these
others, worked out a plan for the raid which was to come off
on September 3, 4 and 5.</p>

<p>Arrangements were made to obtain the Sixty-ninth Regiment
Armory in New York and the Twenty-third Regiment
Armory in Brooklyn, and about 1,000 sailors and 750 soldiers
from posts in New York City were obtained for assistance in
the raids. Two American Protective League operatives were
detailed to each of the one hundred and eighty-nine local
boards in New York, and two to each police station. There
were seventy-five operatives on duty in the Armories in New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
York and about fifty in Brooklyn. There were ten special
agents of D.&nbsp;J. in Brooklyn and twenty in New York. Mr.
DeWoody prepared printed instructions to be used by the sailors,
soldiers and A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operatives in the work.</p>

<p>The system used on the streets was to interrogate a man,
and ask for his registration card and his final classification
card. If he had none, he was taken to the nearest police station,
where he was questioned further by the operatives in
charge, and if thought to be a delinquent, was then sent by a
motor car to the armory to be held. From that point his local
board was communicated with by telephone or telegraph, and
the true status of the man obtained at the earliest possible
moment. In these raids, there were apprehended 21,402 men,
of whom 756 were inducted into the service. There were
found 2,485 men who were delinquents from their local boards.</p>
</div>

<p>Up till December 11, 1918, there were 45,150 filed cases
of a general nature in the New York Division: 3,610 civil
service case, 2,920 passport visés, 471 passport cases,
2,507 overseas investigations, 2,539 investigations of officers’
commissions, and 29,680 cases connected with selective
service matters. This makes a total of 86,877 cases.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that the above numbers apply to folder
numbers only, and many folders contain more than one
case, some of them as high as 250 cases. For instance, the
investigations of a jury panel would be carried all in one
folder under the name of the trial on which that jury was
to sit. The figures in selective service matters are the
actual number of cases turned over to the League at the
time they started work with the various local boards.
Subsequent to this date the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. officers in charge of
the work at the various boards were given thousands of
cases which they reported directly to the board, there
being no file in the office in such instances. The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
Chief of New York therefore thinks it a very conservative
estimate to say that the number of individuals investigated
by the New York Division would run between 300,000 and
400,000. All these cases in the New York office system
were filed alphabetically under the name of the person or
firm to be investigated; for that reason definite figures
could not be given in any summary. As League operatives
became better acquainted with the Chairmen of the Draft
Boards, more and more cases would be turned in directly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
to the Local Boards, which left the files incomplete also in
cases of this character.</p>

<p>On Long Island, near New York, there were several large
military camps, including Camp Mills and Camp Upton,
and several aviation fields. The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. zone inspectors
in charge of Nassau and Suffolk Counties, together with
the Deputy Chief, in charge of Long Island, coöperated
closely with the Intelligence officers of these camps.
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. quite often was of assistance in locating deserters
from these camps, it being the usual thing for an officer
to telegraph A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. to pick up the pursuit.</p>

<p>A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. also investigated a great many cases for the
camp authorities at Camp Wadsworth, Spartanburg, South
Carolina, because this camp was occupied for some time
by the New York National Guard. Sometimes the League
would be asked to investigate the statement of a man who
wanted a furlough because his family in New York was
sick. A great many fraudulent requests of this kind were
discovered. The War Department detailed a special officer
to handle cases of deception of this character, and A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
turned over to him a great deal of information of this
nature as well as many reports which had come in to
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. of the sale of liquor to men in uniform. Captain
Peiffer, the officer in charge of this work, at one time investigated
some thirty hotels in New York City. For more
than two weeks these hotels were covered by A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
operators. This officer had a lieutenant detailed to watch
liquor and vice matters on Long Island, who made his
headquarters at Hempstead. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. officers coöperated
with this lieutenant in every way and gave him much assistance
in closing up saloons and hotels that came within the
five mile limit of the various camps.</p>

<p>Military Intelligence Division, of the General Staff, sent
a great many character and loyalty investigations of overseas
cases, officers’ investigation cases and a large variety
of cases of special investigation of both positive and negative
nature, to A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in New York. A separate department
was established in New York headquarters exclusively
to handle the cases coming to New York Military
Intelligence in Washington. Within the seven months
ending December 11, 1918, the New York office received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
5,046 cases of the types above mentioned. Perhaps a man
going overseas would give from one to ten references, say
an average of four references to each case, which would
mean the interviewing of more than 20,000 individuals at
the request of the War Department in Washington. The
men who did this work did not get a cent for it. The
territory covered by the Division extends from Poughkeepsie,
New York, to Montauk Point, Long Island, a distance
of about 200 miles. The cases would be scattered
all over this territory, and very often the same case would
require two or more investigators.</p>

<p>Beside all of these rather heavy duties in connection with
the big government work, A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. had daily requests from
the Intelligence Office at Governor’s Island, the Port of
Embarkation at Hoboken, and the various other Intelligence
Offices in and around New York City. Every possible
assistance was rendered these various officers. It was
impossible to classify all of this work in the files, so that
the entire number is not available.</p>

<p>As the perfectly interlocking system of intelligence of
the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in the great city became known, the agents of
the Department of Justice and the officers of the various
Military Intelligence services got in the habit of calling
on headquarters at A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. for all sorts of information.
Quite often they would call regarding some case which
needed looking into at a town a long distance away. The
name of an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. division at that point would be given,
and the case turned over to the latter by telegraph. Thus
it is easy to see that the web of New York, expanded into
the web of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. all over America, was of almost incalculable
benefit to all of the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Departments concerned
in any way with the war.</p>

<p>The New York office has conducted some part of the
investigation of almost every alien enemy that has been
interned in that part of the country. Just how much value
the work of the League has had in these various internment
cases, it is difficult to tell. Department of Justice
has sometimes been rather haughty and lofty in regard to
its humbler auxiliary. When New York A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. has
inquired of D.&nbsp;J. as to the outcome of a certain case, sometimes
the answer would be that “proper action will be taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
in due time,” the inference being that D.&nbsp;J. did not want
to be bothered by questions. A like vagueness quite often
enshrouded cases turned over to Military Intelligence.
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. might investigate fifty men for commissions and
never know even whether any of them got a commission.</p>

<p>The offices of the United States Attorneys in both the
Southern and Eastern districts of New York were greatly
overworked, and had a very inadequate staff of assistants.
It was necessary, in many instances, for A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. to take
cases that should have gone to a Federal Court, before
some local magistrate on a disorderly conduct charge.</p>

<p>In brief, the story of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in New York City is very
satisfying indeed. How fortunate for Military Intelligence,
the Draft Boards, the Department of Justice and other
war branches that they had an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. to help them out,
and to do that for nothing! Had this not been the case,
it is not too much to say that these branches of our war
activities would also have broken down as so lamentably
did other portions of our war work—ordnance, equipment,
airplane work, etc., all of which suffered from not
having a quarter million of men at hand to do the work
for nothing and do it right. The truth about this war
never has been known and never will be printed. A lot
of it lies in the files of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.</p>

<p>In the course of the last ten months, according to the
Military Intelligence Bureau, New York Division probably
had more investigations entrusted to it than would in peace
times be made throughout the entire country. Since the
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. men were of the highest type, with all the advantage
of education and wide experience, their ready adaptability
can be taken for granted. But even with the high
average of ability of the League officers and operatives,
the notably fine record of the New York Division would
not have been possible had there not been a most thorough
and up-to-date business system. And such was actually
the case.</p>

<p>A full series of blanks, the use of special cover sheets,
of different colors, and the employment of case covers corresponding
to the cover sheets, so simplified the filing system
and the record of the case itself as to save a great
deal of time and eliminate a great many mistakes. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
instance, the case card would be buff in a case of a “commission”
investigation, green in an “overseas” investigation
and pink for special cases. The card is kept clipped
to its cover sheet until a case is assigned. When it has
been assigned, notation is made on the card and cover
sheet, and the individual record card of the man to whom
assigned. The case is then sent to the operative, and the
case card filed alphabetically under his name in the “out”
box. A separate record card is maintained for each investigator
or district officer. It is thus possible to locate a
case at once, by looking up a name of the subject in the
“out” box of case cards, and to locate what cases are in
the hands of any investigator by looking up his record
card. An equally thorough system was employed in the
handling of reports as they came in.</p>

<p>Without a most efficient system for transacting the business
of the League, the most hopeless confusion must have
obtained among that seething mass of conflicting human
activities. Mere bulk of paper is an incomprehensible
thing, and no one who has not seen the masses of reports
coming in, even to the minor offices of the League, can
understand what the handling of the <i>three million</i> A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
investigations really meant in office work alone.</p>

<p>The Army is divided into the Staff and the Line; otherwise,
the Office and the Field. A similar division may be
made in the American Protective League. The men handling
the records in the central office are more or less
unhonored and unsung. Upon the other hand, the operative
who puts on false eyebrows and a beard and goes out
to stalk a suspect is apt to seem far more the heroic figure,
although what he really is doing is no more than getting
something for the office to file. Neither branch of the
activity ought to be overlooked.</p>

<p>The New York A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. conducted investigations for the
Department of Justice under three heads; the State Department
under two heads; the War Department under five
heads; and also the Navy Department, the Alien Property
Custodian, the Civil Service Commission, the War Trade
Board and the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Shipping Board, as well as the Treasury
Department under three different heads.</p>

<p>When one pauses to reflect on these different classifications<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
of the work and the different ramifications of the
League’s operative forces, one is pretty nearly ready to
admit that without a perfect office system the whole thing
would have been jolly well messed up inside of a week.
This amateur organization sprang into being almost over
night, a smooth-working, modern business machine, which
rendered invaluable services at no cost at all. When you
stop to think of it, this is one of the most wonderful phenomena
of American business life.</p>

<p>The total membership of officers and operatives in the
New York Division numbered over four thousand five hundred
substantial business and professional men, chosen
from every field of activity. They were classified and reclassified
to such an extent that, from speaking any
required language on earth to expert knowledge in any
profession on earth, aid could be furnished on demand.
Two significant facts stand out in comparing New York
with other cities. The first, the rather smaller number of
men; the second, the rather small amount of money spent
in the work. It is due to the excellent business system of
that division that the cost per case was kept so low, for
New York runs more cases to the operative, and more to
the member, than any other city in the country.</p>

THE STORY OF PHILADELPHIA</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Splendid Record of a Ship-Shape Office—A Model Organization
and the Way it Worked—Stories of the Silent Soldiers—A
Banner Report.</p>
</div>

<p>The City of Brotherly Love gives us pause. Is it indeed
the truth that Americans do not know their own country?
The story of the American Protective League, covering
some millions of typewritten words, some hundreds of
thousands of pages of typewritten copy, might be called
one of the largest and one of the best histories of America
ever written. It offers no pretense at deductions, but only
an abundance of facts, objective and not subjective, concrete
and not abstract. Popular impression hath it that
the city founded by good William Penn is a simple and
quiet sort of community, where life goes on lawfully and
all is ease and comfort, peace and content. The facts do
not seem to bear out this supposition. Philadelphia was
as lawless as the next city during war times, possessed of
as many undesirables and offering as many urgent problems
in national defense. Tucson, Arizona, reports peace.
Philadelphia is bad and borderish!</p>

<p>Among the many hundreds of reports coming in during
the closing days of the American Protective League, there
are some which run forty, fifty, or seventy-five pages of
single space type. A very few of such reports would make
a book the size of this one in hand. It has been, let it be
repeated, with a most genuine regret that such work had
to be condensed by the press. The Philadelphia report, for
instance, covers ninety pages, and is an absolute model in
every way. Indeed, a visit to the Philadelphia A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
offices would have left any visitor certain of the high level
of efficiency which has been attained by that division in
every phase of its work. There was not a neater, better-systematized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
or smoother-running division in all the League
than that in bad and borderish Philadelphia. The installation
in that city was not so large as some. A Swiss watch
is not so large as a Big Ben clock, but the latter does not
keep any better time and makes much more noise about it.</p>

<p>It being impossible to print all of the Philadelphia report,
it is quite in order to give rather a full summary of
it, that we may correct the old impression regarding Philadelphia
as a place of peace. The tabulated records cover
only eleven months, from December 26, 1917, to November,
1918. In that period, 18,275 persons were examined, not
counting those who were released in the big slacker raids.
In order that the lay reader may have a perfect idea of
the many different heads of activity in any one of these
great offices, the Philadelphia table is offered in full, precisely
as sent in:</p>

<p class="p2">The beginnings of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in Philadelphia lay in
a meeting of fifty business men, who came together April
9, 1917, and organized as the Philadelphia Branch of the
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. From that time on, varying fortunes and different
personnel attended the League activities. On December
26, 1917, Mr. Mahlon R. Kline, who for years had been in
charge of the Claim Department of the Philadelphia Rapid
Transit Company and had been engaged in secret service
work in other corporations, was appointed Chief of the division.
In February, 1918, there came in with Mr. Kline,
Mr. Frank H. Gaskill, formerly Superintendent of the
Franklin Detective Agency, who also had been associated
with the Claims Department of the Rapid Transit Company.
Although no pretense is made of naming all their
associates, it should be mentioned that to these two men
must be accorded a great deal of the credit for the last
year’s work.</p>

<p>Naturally the question of finances came in early. In
January, 1918, Mr. Horace A. Beale, Jr., president of an
iron company, volunteered to purchase any furniture and
office equipment which might be necessary. This brought
out the need of a permanent fund, and Mr. Beale was one
of the League’s staunchest supporters along these lines.
There was put before the members of the Chamber of
Commerce a plant protection system which has been in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
practice in many American cities. Factory owners paid
into the treasury of the League twenty-five to one hundred
dollars a month, which, for a time, covered the running
expenses of the office even in its growing condition. When
this income became inadequate, Mr. Kline with the Executive
Committee later arranged for an expense account
through the War Chest Fund of $3,000 a month.</p>

<p>There was a handy little cabinet made up by the Bureau
Chief in charge of slackers and deserters, which contained
the following card index information: Names, addresses
and telephone numbers of members to be counted on at
any hour; names of members taking assignments in the several
districts; names of members willing to accept assignments
in any section. This cabinet contains the address and
telephone numbers of all members owning yachts, motor
cars, etc.; also a record of members speaking the following
languages: German, French, Italian, Spanish, Yiddish,
Hungarian, Swedish, Russian, Dutch, Pennsylvania Dutch,
Danish, Portuguese, Chinese, Polish, Greek, Esperanto, Laplandish,
Korean, Japanese, Austrian, Slavish and Latin.</p>

<p>The League in Philadelphia did not attempt secrecy.
On the contrary, it openly availed itself of the services of
the newspapers, and had the confident backing of all the
great journals. It did not always go out after its man
personally, but saved a great deal of time by inventing a
little form letter which read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Mr. John Doe:
</p>

<p>Kindly call at this office immediately upon receipt of this
letter with reference to a matter of great importance. Bring
this letter with you and ask for Mr. Bouton.</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 8.5em;">Respectfully,</span><br>
American Protective League.
</p>
</div>

<p>This was the letter sent out to draft evaders. It was
thought at first it would not work, but, as a matter of fact,
it brought in a stream of men who otherwise would have
needed to be found. Once in the office, the rest was easy.</p>

<p>At the time that Mr. Kline came into the League there
were 1,225 members. Additional members were selected
with great care, but politics, religion, lodge affiliations, and
so forth, were not factors in the working of the League.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
There were on February 7, 1919, 3,440 members of the
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in Philadelphia, all working for purely patriotic
motives.</p>

<p>The training of operatives under the skilled secret service
instruction available in the division offices resulted in
losing a good many men to the Department of Justice
forces, who were not slow to recognize the value of good,
well-trained men when they saw them. There were many
departments of the United States Government which lie
under deep debt to-day to the Philadelphia office of the
American Protective League.</p>

<p>The Philadelphia work was perhaps most famous through
its great system of drives. That city is indeed the original
drive center, and there, better than anywhere else, perhaps,
may be seen the working of a thoroughly differentiated
system of drag-nets. There were a number of these
raids which may be summarized briefly.</p>

<p>The first was a small affair conducted on May 17, 1918,
which took in a couple of roadhouses where uniformed
men were buying liquor.</p>

<p>The second raid was conducted on July 15, 1918, when
about 2,000 members swooped down on the Tenderloin
district of Chester, Pennsylvania, arresting about four hundred
persons, mostly of the lowest type. About ninety
per cent of these prisoners were convicted for bootlegging
or crimes of a worse character—denizens of the section
known as Bethel Court and Leiper’s Flat, which the officers
call the worst hell-holes they have ever seen—“such
places as make the Mexican border look like a Sunday
School picnic,” says one. In this tough district many desperate
characters were met who were quick to use
weapons; but the agents of the law sustained practically
no personal injuries.</p>

<p>Other raids followed, the sixth taking place on August
2, 1918, at Woodside Park, an amusement place which
was filled with slackers. Two hundred A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. members
and agents of D.&nbsp;J. surrounded the place and handled in
all 2,000 men, out of which more than three hundred were
detained.</p>

<p>The seventh raid was August 6, 1918—the great slacker
raid on Shibe Park, at the time when there was a crowd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
of 8,000 men gathered to witness the Jack Thompson-Sam
Langford prize fight. There were twenty agents of D.&nbsp;J.,
two hundred A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. members and one hundred Philadelphia
police. They examined over 2,000 men between
the ages of twenty-one and thirty-two, and held one hundred
and forty-one as deserters or evaders.</p>

<p>The eighth raid, August 15, 1918, was set at Atlantic
City, N. J., and is considered the daddy of them all. At
that time four pleasure piers were raided, and more than
60,000 men, women and children were handled without
commotion. Preparations for this raid were left to Mr.
Gaskill, since he had done so well with other raids. In
the call for the assembly the members did not know where
they were going—they got sealed directions. At 10:00
P. M. sharp, the entrance and exit guards took up positions
and refused to allow any males to leave the pier
without showing classification cards, if within draft age.
The other squads of from fifty to seventy-five men were
instructed to proceed to the ocean end of the pier, form
a solid line and sweep all men within the above mentioned
ages, found without papers, to a point at the board walk
end of the pier where they were detained until the work
had been completed, after which they were transferred to
the armory for further examination. There were about
seven hundred men apprehended in that raid and sixty
real slackers. It was an all-night job, the members from
Philadelphia arriving home about seven o’clock as quietly
as they had slipped out of town.</p>

<p>On November 6, 1918, the Olympia Athletic Club was
raided, and out of the 8,000 men who had gathered to
witnessed the Dempsey-Levinsky prize fight, more than
1,000 were detained, thirty-six of which proved real draft
evaders. This bunch of fight fans was handled by one
hundred and twenty-five A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. members, forty police,
and twelve agents of the Department of Justice.</p>

<p>The signing of the armistice on the eleventh of November
ended the slacker raids, but having its hand well
skilled by this time, the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. went on with vice raids
and picked up a great many people who had not complied
with the draft laws. On November 20, 1918, Chester, Pa.,
was again raided and an additional forty-two prisoners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
apprehended. The next three days were put in with Tenderloin
raids for bootleggers, of whom sixty were sentenced
to nine months’ imprisonment.</p>

<p>It is probable that the Philadelphia division has worked
out the raid matter as exactly as any other division of the
country. The Chief had a carefully-drawn diagram or map
made, showing the system by which the men were stationed.
It is a good instance of the Web of the Law. The chart shows
fifteen squads of men traveling north and south, east and
west, in a systematic covering of a bootleg territory 10 by 15
squares. Therefore, one squad travels north on one street
and south on another street, while the squad working on
opposite sides to them travels east and then west in the
same manner. This makes it absolutely impossible for an
offender to operate without an agent seeing him. It was
often noticed that a bootlegger approaching a uniformed
man would be almost instantly surrounded by one or two
or even three squads who closed in to make the arrest.
Philadelphia had the hunting of the bootlegger down to a
fine point.</p>

<p>Mr. Todd Daniel, Superintendent of the Department of
Justice for Philadelphia, has always been an ardent admirer
of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. In return, the League has supplied
him on request with fifty to one hundred motor cars each
month, and investigated as many as 1,000 cases which his
staff would have been unable to handle. No wonder he
admires them.</p>

<p>Surveillance such as this kept property damages in and
around this great industrial center at a minimum. The
Eddystone Munition Plant explosion occurred previous to
the organization of the League. The Woodbury Bag Loading
Plant, Woodbury, N. J., was so well covered that
although a great many attempts to cause explosions and
set fires were made with bombs and inflammable materials,
they all failed of their purpose. No one can tell how much
property loss was averted through the work of the Philadelphia
division. It would be invidious to quote any, and
hopeless to quote all, of the many letters of approval received
from persons high in Government, political and
commercial circles, complimenting the division upon its
efficiency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>Needless to say, Philadelphia had her own share of
<i>causes celébrès</i>. One of the most unique and interesting
of these was that of the Philadelphia <i>Tageblatt</i>, a German
daily newspaper prosecuted under the charge of seditious
and disloyal utterances. In the fall of 1917, a raid was
conducted by D.&nbsp;J. and A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. upon the headquarters
of this paper, at which time many files, books, papers, and
so forth, were seized, with the result that warrants were
issued for the editor and all his staff. When they were
called for trial, members of the division were again used
for the purpose of investigating the jury panel, as well as
for the procurement of evidence essential to the case. In
one item, this work took the form of securing through
banking members, proofs of certain signatures without
which the Government’s case would have been crippled.</p>

<p>These men were tried for treason, but were discharged
for lack of evidence. They were subsequently prosecuted
under a charge of conspiracy to hinder voluntary enrollment
and for violation of the Espionage Act. On the latter
charge, they were found guilty. Louis Werner, the editor,
and his associate, Martin Darkow, got five years’ imprisonment
each, Herman Lemke two years, Peter Shaefer and
Paul Vogel, one year each.</p>

<p>The <i>Tageblatt</i> had been warned often against its
unseemly utterances, but to no avail. It was a sheet of
no great consequence, and about fifteen years ago was
anarchistic. Then it turned to Socialism. When war was
declared, it was outspoken against the Allies. After the
declaration it became more cautious, but its columns were
full of propaganda. It had no telegraph or cable service,
but its policy was dictated by the selective choice of its
editorial staff. Louis Werner was a naturalized citizen
born in Germany. Darkow was a non-registered alien
enemy and wrote the editorials. The president was Peter
Shaefer, the treasurer Paul Vogel, and the business manager
Herman Lemke. The trial for treason lasted only
ten days. The second trial, for conspiracy, was more successful
from the viewpoint of the law. Upon the stand,
both Werner and Darkow were insolent. They will have
time to think over all these matters in quiet for a while.</p>

<p>Red Cross frauds attracted some attention on the part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
of the League in Philadelphia, which investigated all sorts
of fanciful rumors, as well as several schemes of fraudulent
or nearly fraudulent or unworthy nature. One of
these, purporting to collect for a central hospital, seemed
at first to have merit; but when advertisements appeared
offering solicitors a highly lucrative connection, the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
agents discovered that this was for the purpose of raising
about $1,500,000—out of which a commission of twenty
per cent was to be paid to the solicitors. A halt was called
on this, but the same people got busy again about three
months later with a campaign purporting to collect
$1,000,000 for the care of “crippled negro soldiers.”
There was a fund of about $10,000 which had been contributed
by colored persons. Some of the people connected
with this movement were well-meaning and absolutely disinterested;
yet in the background were others who appeared
to be out for the coin. The campaign was closed
down again. This is but a sample of other affairs of the
same sort.</p>

<p>One of the notable Philadelphia affairs was that of Norman
T. <span class="nowrap">W——</span>, scholar, patent attorney, chess expert
and draft evader. This case originated in Washington
where he failed to appear for examination or to turn in
a questionnaire. He asked to have his examination transferred
to Philadelphia, so the whole matter was transferred
to Philadelphia. On July 15, <span class="nowrap">W——</span> was mailed his
order for induction into the service and was told to report
July 24, but he did not appear. Philadelphia A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
then took on the matter.</p>

<p>W—— was the son of respectable Philadelphia parents
and of good connections. Without doubt, he and his
brother were shielded by their relatives and friends as
long as possible. On November 8, the Philadelphia Division
of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. wired Washington stating that <span class="nowrap">W——</span> had
been apprehended. On November 16, 1918, he was sent to
Camp Dix.</p>

<p>The public has some notion of the great plant for ship
construction erected at Hog Island, near Philadelphia, by
the United States Shipping Board. All sorts of stories
came out regarding affairs at this shipping yard, and the
charges were so direct and well-supported that Congress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
finally investigated the matter. The Philadelphia Division
of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. had some part in this investigation, which
had to do with charges of extravagance, graft and waste
of public moneys. There was one item, the employment
of thousands of jitney drivers, which was severely criticised.
These cars were employed by the Emergency Fleet
Corporation to transport their workmen from their homes
to the Island, since it was thought the regular transportation
lines could not handle them. The charge was made
that large amounts were collected by the jitney men from
the Shipping Yard without rendering any service; the
shipping yards, in turn, charged these amounts back to
the Government. There were thousands of reports turned
in by the operatives to D.&nbsp;J. on these “jitney cases.” It
was found that a good many men in authority were in
the habit of ordering the drivers, after they had brought
them down to the Shipping Yard, to go back home and
place themselves at the disposal of the members of the
families of the foremen or officers—the Government thus
supporting a large number of private automobiles for salaried
persons. The entire matter quieted down when the
increased cost of tires and gas deprived the jitney drivers
of their profits, and when competition came on through
the installation of better service and equipment by the
Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company.</p>

<p>There was no branch of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. activities in Philadelphia
so carefully handled as that having to do with
the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. and other radical organizations. There were
five Locals found and fifty-one revolutionary clubs with
a total membership of 5,000, ninety per cent of whom were
of foreign birth, absolutely opposed to all government and
ever ready to overthrow law by revolutionary tactics.</p>

<p>The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. made a raid upon one club solely for the
purpose of seizing literature and files. As a result of this,
fifty I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. agitators were dismissed from shipping
yards and government plants. Some of these were in the
Government Bag Loading Plant at Woodbury, in the shipping
yard at Bristol, and in the Emergency Fleet Corporation
at Hog Island. All these Philadelphia radicals contributed
heavily to the defense fund of the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. members
who were on trial in Chicago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>It was thought desirable to find any possible connection
of German interest with these radicals. At one meeting
the discovery was made that two men appeared and made
a contribution to the foregoing defense fund. They came
from a Fairmount German singing society—where they
sang anything but American patriotic airs. The League
kept close watch on all these radical organizations, so close
that they have not dared to make any outright break.
The slightest step out of the proper path would mean an
immediate reckoning with men who have been rather stern
in matters of justice.</p>

<p>After the <i>Tageblatt</i> case, which was the first case in the
entire country resulting in a conviction under the indictments
which were brought against Werner and his associates,
the Grover Bergdoll case of mysterious disappearance
is perhaps Philadelphia’s greatest contribution to
detective literature. Indeed, there is still chance for a
good detective in Philadelphia who can give bond for the
production of the body of Grover C. Bergdoll, college
athlete, wealthy young man-about-town, skillful mechanician,
student of law, X-ray experimenter, radical editor—and
draft evader. The Bergdoll brothers, Grover and
Irwin, are known as the “slackers de luxe.” They were
sons of a wealthy brewer, and having money, it seemed
to them that they need not respect the law. They had
shown their contempt for it before the draft reached out
for them. Grover C. did not register, and Irwin failed to
file his questionnaire. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. was set on their trail, but
the young men had both disappeared. From that time
until now neither of these men has been apprehended.
Grover C. Bergdoll was seen in Mexico, was alleged to
have been in the West on a ranch, was reported to have
been in Spain, was said to have been seen in Western New
York, and was reported also to have been in Philadelphia
twice. Sometimes he would send a card to the newspapers
just to tantalize the public, or to the officials whom he
knew to be after him. Well, money is a present friend
in times of trouble. For a time the Bergdoll mystery will
remain a mystery. One of these days the life of the Bergdoll
boys will fail to interest them. One of these days the
law will lay its hands on them, and they will have to settle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
with the country which they have slighted and scorned
and whose citizenship they do not deserve.</p>

<p>It may have occurred to readers of these pages that
there was not enough blood and thunder stuff pulled off
by the operatives of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. It is quite possible that
the Department of Justice men have had the harder load
to carry in these more violent affairs, because quite often
they are obliged to make the actual arrest, on warrants
under evidence obtained by the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. One Philadelphia
incident resulted in the killing of the man sought—a
negro desperado who carried several aliases but was best
known in the saloon district as “Porto Rico.”</p>

<p>On Friday, November 8, two men of the League, in
trying to locate a suspect, found two colored men in military
uniform whom they followed. These gave up the
whereabouts of two of their companions who were in a
certain house. When found, these men claimed they had
been drugged and robbed by some colored women there.
It had been their present plan to wait there in the darkness
until the women came back and then to kill them.
The whole scene was in a tough part of town where the
uniform of the United States does not belong.</p>

<p>Out of these proceedings the operatives got the address
of four other men, one of these Porto Rico, who were supposed
to be in the habit of robbing colored soldiers and
other men in uniform. A certain saloon was visited by
the operatives, and a few minutes after they appeared, a
burly negro entered and was accosted as “Porto Rico” by
the owner. The two operatives were C. H. Keelor of the
League and Mr. Sprague of the Department of Justice.
Keelor tapped Porto Rico on the arm and asked him for
his card. The man got into action at once, kicked Keelor
in the leg and struck Sprague, knocking him down. He
made a leap to the open and pulled a heavy revolver,
starting to retreat northeast on Lombard Street.</p>

<p>Operative Logan was on the opposite side of the street,
and he now closed in. There was a shot fired, perhaps by
a friend of Porto Rico. The latter raised his revolver and
took aim at Sprague. Sprague was armed with a heavy
holster gun and beat the negro to the shot, killing him
with a bullet through the heart. Porto Rico fell, his revolver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
dropping from his hand, and such was his vitality
that for a long time he struggled to reach the gun as it
lay close by him. Sprague was cleared in court, as he shot
obviously in self-defense. Charles Seamore, alias John E.
Manuel, alias Porto Rico, was a notorious gun man. Beside
his revolver he carried a razor and a number of 38-calibre
cartridges. His registration card showed that he
had registered under a false name. In almost the same
place a little while later a Philadelphia policeman was shot
by a negro, who in turn was killed by a lieutenant of the
police department.</p>

<p>In May, 1918, Major C. N. Green, <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Engineers, came
into the League Headquarters of the Philadelphia Division
and said he wanted assistance in organizing secret service
work for plant protection and that he had been directed
to the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. offices. Out of this later grew the connection
of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. with the Woodbury Bag Loading
Plant.</p>

<p>At first there were about one hundred buildings on the
1,800 acres of unfenced land, about two hundred men
being engaged in guarding the place. An organization
of proved men had been made, which went directly into
Government service. Five strikes were settled and no
serious labor trouble resulted. It seemed marvelous that
no disaster occurred in this plant. Time and again enemies
attached time bombs to powder cars on their way to the
munition plant. These cars were all stopped on an outside
siding and searched, sometimes as many as thirty in one
night. One time a bomb was found and two sticks of
dynamite. A great deal of oily waste was found, which
was no doubt attached in the hope that it might be set
afire and so cause destruction of the car. There were two
hundred and ten arrests made under charge of disorderly
conduct, and one hundred under charge of trespassing.
In each of these cases a conviction was secured. About
two hundred violators of the Selective Service Act were
put under arrest, and, as has been stated, thirty-five members
of the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. were removed from the premises.
More than one hundred and ten Austrians and Hungarians
were discharged, and about two hundred aliens sent to the
Department of Justice for examination. Over 1,500 investigations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
of suspects were made by the League, largely of
men whose names seemed to proclaim them of German
extraction. The record of this plant is unique, it probably
being the only plant that has had so low a record of fires,
explosions and accidents in all the history of our war work.</p>

<p>Guards often found people endeavoring to do damage.
One such man had piled up scrap lumber and rags and
was touching it off when fired upon by the guard. Two
other attempts were made to destroy another one of the
buildings. Not content with protecting the property from
without, the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. even protected it from within.
Charges were made of extravagant prices paid by the
Government, a fact which strongly indicated graft somewhere.
A corporation had made a bid to furnish boxes at
$450 each, delivered. This bid was refused. Volunteer
workers were called on to make these boxes. The work
was done on Sunday, double time being paid—each man
receiving $14 a day—and even with such labor charges,
it was found the boxes could be turned out at $17.25!
This particular expenditure of money was stopped by the
artless Ordnance Department. One or two chiefs were dismissed
on the strength of reports from the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. of
inefficiency, graft and irregularities.</p>

<p>This, then, all too briefly and lamely done in review, is
the story of Philadelphia, which operated one of the very
best amateur detective agencies the world has ever seen
and which was a credit not only to Philadelphia itself but
to every operative of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. wherever he was located
in the United States.</p>

<p>It only remains to say that in the monthly report for
December, 1918, the Philadelphia Division turns in forty-eight
bootleggers additional, two hold-up men, and nine
soldiers absent without leave. It furnished D.&nbsp;J. in that
month six hundred and forty-five men and sixty-five cars,
investigated in that month two hundred and fifty-two draft
evaders, seven hundred and forty-three cases from D.&nbsp;J.
and various branches of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L., and 1,812 office assignments
and Washington investigations. The Division closed
the month of December, after the Armistice, going strong,
with a membership of 3,438.</p>

<p>On the last day of the year, and after Philadelphia had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
finished all its reports for the year, there was a bomb
outrage in that city in which lawless persons blew up the
homes of three citizens. A call to the City Hall brought
out every available detective and policeman, and houses of
other prominent men were placed under guard for that
night. Once more the drag-net was put out to take in
the lawless and all those of Bolshevik tendencies. The
outrage was of such a nature that the Philadelphia papers
carried editorials almost appealing to the American Protective
League not to disband. Truly it will be missed in
that city and in many another city of America. In this
bomb outrage the lives of women and children were endangered.
What are we to think of America for the future
if at will the superintendent of police, a judge of the court,
and a president of a chamber of commerce are to have
their houses blown up as an act of vengeance of wholly
irresponsible people such as no doubt committed this crime!</p>

<p>Early in January, 1919, Mr. Frank H. Gaskill, Assistant
Chief, was promoted to be Chief of the Philadelphia Division
for its closing days, Mr. Mahlon R. Kline resigning in
his favor. The demobilization banquet of Philadelphia
Division A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. was held on the night of February 5,
1919, and it was as fine and ship-shape as all the other
activities of the Division. It was hard for these men to
say good-bye. Indeed, it is quite probable that many of
the old Philadelphia A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. members will organize, under
another name, for purposes somewhat similar.</p>

THE STORY OF NEWARK</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Big Division of Northern New Jersey—Hot-Bed of Spydom
and Anarchy—Cases from the Files—Guarding the Gate
to the Sea.</p>
</div>

<p>Northern New Jersey was recognized as one of the riskiest
regions of the United States. Time out of mind, American
readers have noted, with the short-lived American
anger, the many newspaper tales of Paterson and anarchy,
of New Jersey and New Thought, of socialistic ranters
hailing from this or that semi-foreign community, in one
of the oldest states in the American union, whose battlefields
in our first war for freedom are spread on many
glorious pages of our country’s history. The battlefields
of Jersey are different now, and are not so glorious. Still,
a few men, as patriotic as those in Revolutionary days,
have done their best during this war to keep their country
safe. The work of the Northern New Jersey Division,
which has been in charge of Mr. W. D. McDermid, as State
Inspector, is reassuring.</p>

<p>It is proper to point out that the Northern New Jersey
Division, being one of the first of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. to be organized,
operated on lines different from those of almost any
other territory. Its district covers one-half of the state,
including the vitally important Port of Embarkation.
Under a single central office, it combined over one hundred
municipalities, most of which would ordinarily have had a
separate headquarters organization, but which for local reasons
had all been consolidated in one division.</p>

<p>There was abundance to do, and there were plenty to
be watched. There could, for example, be furnished several
hundred instances of sabotage in this manufacturing
district of Northern New Jersey—sabotage either detected
in advance, or thoroughly investigated afterwards. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
was so common in the hundreds of plants in that District
that it became for the Northern Division, for the most
part, a matter of routine. A great deal of the work of
this character ultimately was handled by the Plant Protection
Division of the War Department.</p>

<p>In upper New Jersey, as in the State of New York, the
Governmental departments reached out and rather overshadowed,
in glory at least, the patient and less known
efforts of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. Newark frankly complains that
quite often sufficiently vigorous action was not to be had
by the officers of the Department of Justice, even after
full evidence had been handed to it by the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. Some
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. men even go so far as to claim that D.&nbsp;J. would
not only crab an act, but claim a glory! Our State Inspector
voices this in occasional comment:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In particular reference to two cases of ours, it is a source
of great disappointment and a great deal of harsh criticism
that the Department of Justice has seen fit to take the position
toward our evidence that it has. Their indifference has led us
to secure a number of clean-cut convictions in state courts
under local laws. These, of course, have not the scope of
Federal laws, under which these cases might very much better
have been prosecuted. We feel that in common justice to the
work of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L., some such comment as this should be
made.</p>
</div>

<p>There was abundant fire behind some of these New Jersey
smokes, be sure of that, and many rumors of the class
commonly pooh-poohed at by M.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;D. and D.&nbsp;J. were made
good. Three actual samples of powdered glass in food
were found; two actual cases of Red Cross bandages containing
deleterious substances also were found; there was
one instance of insidious printed propaganda distributed
by means of knitted work; and there was a very distinct
trail of Sinn Feiners working in conjunction with the
enemy. To these may be added such instances of investigation
as are given below.</p>

<p>Mr. X, a minister of the gospel, was very offensive in
his pacifism. He refused permission for the display of an
American flag in his church, or even a service flag, and
would not allow the church to be used for Red Cross work.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
He was forced to resign, his particular brand of piety not
seeming to track with the creed of his congregation. The
quality of his pacifism may be judged from the fact that
he excused the Germans for their atrocities, saying that
if France and Belgium had not resisted, there never would
have been any atrocities! This man applied for a position
to go to France in Government war work. His application
was refused.</p>

<p>It is, of course, well known that the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> troops in large
part sailed from the vicinity of the City of New York, or
upper New Jersey. Of course, also, all the preparations
for this war, all of the expense of it, all the time and
trouble of it, focused exactly on the number of troops we
actually could get on the way. The utmost secrecy was
maintained by our Government as to the number of troops,
the ships that carried them, and the time and place of
sailing. The mother of a boy on his way to France did
not know he had sailed until a curt card from the other
side of the water told her that he was in France. Practically
all the people of the United States, however, accepted
this secrecy as a necessary war measure—that
being obviously and permanently necessary in this war,
where the risks of the sea included the danger of the
German submarine.</p>

<p>Naturally, also, the German spies on this side of the
water would do everything in their power to learn precisely
the facts which our Government sought to conceal—the
number of troops going over, the times of sailings
of the transports, and so forth. Naturally also, our system
of espionage—the divisions of Military Intelligence, Naval
Intelligence, Department of Justice, and the auxiliary work
of the American Protective League—would do all they
could to prevent German espionage from attaining its own
purpose in regard to this knowledge.</p>

<p>When the Government seized the Port of Embarkation
at Hoboken, much interest was shown in the former Hamburg-American
and North German Lloyd line steamers
located there. There were numerous rumors that these
boats were to be blown up by the Germans. Of these,
the largest was the <i>Vaterland</i>, which was re-christened
<i>Leviathan</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>All this section, along the Jersey Palisades, near Hoboken,
is strong in sympathy for Germany. Nearly all of
the population is from Germany or of German parentage
and here was this steamer, the biggest of all the boats, and
long the pride of the Germans. It was not to be expected
that the New Jersey Germans would feel pleasant about
its present status. These local Germans boasted that they
had been through these boats after our Government took
them over. They told stories of what the Government was
doing with them and what they were going to do themselves
so that the boats would never sail or never get
across. The history of other ships which took fire in mid-ocean,
or were blown up by concealed explosives is referred
to elsewhere. It always was sufficient to make the sailing
of any transport a matter of great uneasiness.</p>

<p>An A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operative wanted to know what these Germans
were doing regarding the <i>Leviathan</i>. Of course, the
boat was supposed to be absolutely guarded against entry
by any stranger. This man, however, went to the gate
and asked for the Commandant by nickname. The guard
supposed he must be a friend of the Commandant, because
of his familiarity, and naïvely let him through. The operative
walked up and down the pier wondering how he could
get on board, for he saw guards at the gangway. There
was a pile of mailbags on the dock, so the operative stole
over that way, picked up a mail sack and threw it over his
shoulder. Near the gangway there was a group of soldiers
and sailors engaged in an argument. As the operative
approached, they separated, and he went through. He was
dressed in civilian clothes, and had on a derby hat, but
these did not seem to be suspicious facts. The operative
walked on up the gangplank unmolested, and roamed all
over the boat from top to bottom, still carrying the mailbag.
Having done what any German could have done in
the same circumstances, he started out, but near the gangway
was stopped by a man who wore a watchman’s badge,
and who spoke with a noticeable German accent. This
man stopped the operative, who, upon being asked where
he was going, replied that he was going off the boat. The
watchman told him to get off in a hurry. He was still
carrying his <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> mail sack, which he replaced on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
pile where he had got it. After that, he strolled out to
the street again, satisfied that the guard around the
<i>Leviathan</i> might have been a trifle more airtight.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, while the sailing dates of the
<i>Leviathan</i> were jealously guarded, bets were made by
the Germans on her sailing time out and back. Word
came to an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. man that the <i>Leviathan</i> was going to
sail at 12:15 the next day. As this came from German
sources, it seemed a useful thing to have the Government
alter the sailing hour. The operative in this case strolled
around in the vicinity of the <i>Leviathan</i>’s pier and talked
with sailors, who freely told him the sailing hour. Then,
in order to mystify the Government officers, the operative
called up a certain Department and said over the ’phone
that he was an Intelligence official of the Imperial German
Navy, and wanted to know if it was true that the
<i>Leviathan</i> was to sail at 12:15 the next day. This caused
some excitement. The operative then told whom he was,
explaining that he had got that knowledge himself the previous
evening. As a result, the sailing hour was changed
several hours, and the <i>Leviathan</i> got off safely.</p>

<p>Again, there were a great many rumors regarding the
numbers of troops carried by this big transport. We did
not want Germany to know how many men we really were
shipping, and we rather thought that no one ever could
know. An A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operative was able to make a very
close guess under rather singular circumstances. Since
he could have done so, perhaps a German spy might have
done as much had he an equally sharp wit.</p>

<p>This instance really started in a practical joke. The
jokers suggested to a certain young husband, who had to
sit up late several nights with a crying baby, that he might
pass the time counting the cars of troop trains which
passed in front of his house. In all seriousness, the young
man did do this, checking each car by the bumps it made
on the railroad frogs. He really counted in this way with
very fair accuracy the number of cars carrying troops
for the <i>Leviathan</i>’s sailing. As everyone knew about how
many troops were in each car, this operative figured that
there would be about 12,000 troops. This was reported
to the Government, but was never checked out, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. still wants to know whether they were good detectives
or not.</p>

<p>There was a member of the Division who sold automobile
tires. A Naval officer came to him to buy a tire, and
wanted to know if the tire could not get to the boat that
afternoon. This salesman suggested the next morning at
noon. The officer innocently said that he would have
sailed by that time. He also named his boat, the <i>Leviathan</i>.
This salesman asked how it would do to have the tire ready
when the ship came back, and asked how long it would be.
The officer said sixteen and a half days—which tallied
with the former <i>Leviathan</i> record of seventeen days. The
salesman also learned that the stop at Bordeaux was from
forty to seventy-two hours. Incidentally, he also learned
that the boat carried 12,000 troops, had five hundred officers
and a crew of fifteen hundred.</p>

<p>This figure of 12,000 troops checks perfectly with the
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. estimate made by the baby-carrying member. This
tire-hunting officer of the boat also told a great many
things which he ought not to have told anyone. He told
the means used to protect the <i>Leviathan</i> against U-boats,
saying that the ship depended mostly on her speed. He
said the ship drew only forty-two feet of water, so it had
not been necessary to dredge the channel at Bordeaux.
The operative then asked the officer how late he could
receive the tire, and was told about two hours before sailing.
“You can refer to your local newspapers and figure
on fifteen minutes after the tide begins to go out,” he said.
This, of course, was so that the boat could get the benefit
of the ebb tide in warping out.</p>

<p>From these facts, both the Military and Naval Intelligence
were able to stop such leaks of information, and
stiffened up the guarding of ships and cargo, besides giving,
in many ways, a far greater degree of protection to
the task of embarkation. It is thought that the League
investigations caused recommendation to be made regarding
more secrecy in regard to embarkation. The Armistice
cut off these matters. Sufficient has been shown here, however,
to indicate how an enemy might sometimes get information.</p>

<p>There did not seem to be much to start with in this case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
which originated in Northern New Jersey, nor indeed was
there much left of the case by the time it was finished.
Yet the case itself had the makings of quite a big affair.
A report came in that Otto <span class="nowrap">B——</span>, starter for the X. Y. Z.
Transit Company, was pro-German. Such reports came in
all the time, so that there were usually fifty or sixty cases
in the zone. Two days later came in more facts from
operative C-123. He had gotten pretty thick with Herr
B—— by saying that Germany seemed to be gaining,
and that this news would please his wife, who was German
herself. Herr <span class="nowrap">B——</span> was much pleased to learn this,
and went on to unbosom himself. Several such meetings
enabled C-123 to learn pretty much everything he desired.</p>

<p>Herr <span class="nowrap">B——</span> wanted to do something for the Fatherland
and the Kaiser. He was sure he could do something
if he had some help. The one danger was that, in talking
to almost anybody, Herr <span class="nowrap">B——</span> might be talking not to
a representative of the Kaiser but to some one who would
report him to the United States Secret Service. Operative
C-123 agreed with him as to this, and gravely told him he
ought to be very careful. But he said he knew a man that
could be trusted, and he would bring him around so that
they could talk it over, and perhaps the two of them
could do something for the Kaiser.</p>

<p>The name of this new man was Schultz. He had been
in Mexico organizing the United States Germans who had
fled to Mexico. He had been a member of the Dantzig
Dragoons, and had traveled all through Germany, and his
experiences in the Army there had gotten him his place
as German propagandist of Mexico. He was a member of
the Imperial German Espionage System—and he had his
Wilhelmstrasse card to show it. He always carried it
pinned to his underclothing. It was a great day for Otto,
the train dispatcher. At last he had some trusted fellow-Germans
in whom he could confide! He and Schultz
talked bombs and that sort of thing until midnight. Herr
B—— told Schultz: “You can depend on me—I am
the real stuff—I can get a thousand men back of me
since I know I have got a man from the German Government
here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>Talks between these three gentlemen were going on in
fine shape at the time the Armistice was signed. As a
matter of fact, Otto <span class="nowrap">B——</span> is still flagging trains at the
old railroad crossing, and the League is recommending his
prosecution and the revocation of his citizenship, because
it certainly had proof of his unfitness to live in the United
States. It hardly seems necessary to add that “Schultz”
was an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operative also. His “credentials” were
made in the United States and not in Germany, having
been copied from those captured on a real agent of the
Kaiser.</p>

<p>There was another near-case, one which almost became
a real one, in Northern New Jersey Division, which, at
the first, looked like scores that had preceded it and scores
that followed it. It had to do with one <span class="nowrap">K——</span>, reported
rabid against America, although employed in doing essential
Government work. This might have been a spite case,
or a case of remarks made before we went into the war,
or still more possibly something said before the amended
Espionage Act was passed. However, member C-891 went
out on the case to see what he could find about <span class="nowrap">K——</span>.</p>

<p>The latter had a factory of his own, and when found,
seemed to be disposed to talk. The operative speaks a
perfect German, and has a German look. The two got on
handsomely. The operative was surprised to find that
K—— talked so freely and to a stranger. Another member
of the League, C-1378, also of German parentage, went
with C-891 a few days later to visit <span class="nowrap">K——</span> again. That
gentleman was more bitter than ever against America. He
said, among other things, that if he heard that President
Wilson had been shot, he would be so glad that he would
celebrate it by getting too drunk to see. And there was
very much more talk of that nature.</p>

<p>A few days later, <span class="nowrap">K——</span> had cause to regret his disposition
to talk. He was brought before a United States
Commissioner on a warrant, and spent a good night in jail
before he could find bail. The next day, he being a man
of means, he engaged a lawyer. The Armistice ended these
activities, as it did so many others. The hearing was held
on the morning of November 7—the first news of the
Armistice, later confirmed. Since that time, A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
Northern New Jersey has heard nothing about Mr.
K——. With a couple million others, he has been
allowed to sink back to our citizenship—just as poisonous,
just as unregenerate, just as little fit to remain in this
country. It was understood that D.&nbsp;J. laid down a rule
that testimony secured in conversations such as the foregoing
was not a basis of prosecution. Perhaps it would
have been better to wait until Mr. <span class="nowrap">K——</span> had really shot
somebody or blown up a ship or so.</p>

<p>Of active sympathizers with the enemy, Northern New
Jersey did not lack. A thousand cases could be given.
One will serve. In July, 1918, the office learned of suspicious
activities on the part of some of these sympathizers.
A Mr. <span class="nowrap">E——</span> was told by Miss <span class="nowrap">G——</span>, a young woman
of foreign birth, that the people she lived with had active
connections with the enemy. Especially was this true in
the case of one <span class="nowrap">S——</span>, who had Central and South American
relations. This latter man was found to be of American
birth and German parentage—which, in a good many
cases, would leave him German. He had been a traveler,
and a son of his had been born in Kingston, Jamaica,
although this son was at present in the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Army. This
Mr. <span class="nowrap">S——</span> was found to be identified with a New York
concern which had sent him to Jamaica to get the release
there of a man jailed by the English authorities for alleged
implication in the coaling of German raiders at sea. That
did not look any too good for Mr. <span class="nowrap">S——</span> of itself. He
also had in his employ a stenographer whose husband, a
Mr. <span class="nowrap">W——</span>, had been employed in an alleged poisoning
of the reservoir at Kingston, Jamaica.</p>

<p>These things led up to the case of the subject, who will
be called <span class="nowrap">P——</span>. This man had lived with <span class="nowrap">S——</span> for
a time. <span class="nowrap">P——</span> came to this country from Germany in
1907, and applied for his first naturalization papers—please
note the date—August 1, 1914. He was thirty-five
years of age, well educated, unmarried, and without dependents.
He had served in the German Army, but was
not a reservist. In his alien enemy questionnaire, he left
out the name of one of his previous employers, which was
found to have been an importing concern with a German
name, with connections in Kingston, Jamaica, doing business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
in Central and South America. This German concern
had many different names. Some of its personnel were
interned at Panama. A member of the concern had been
interned in the United States for alleged provisioning of
German raiders at sea. This made the stage set for a
rather interesting investigation. Operatives discovered
that the principal men of this concern were at large,
and were doing business under yet another name. They
also discovered that this Mr. <span class="nowrap">S——</span> was affiliated with
the work in a downtown office building in New York City.</p>

<p>During 1912, or earlier, Mr. <span class="nowrap">S——</span> had introduced Mr.
P—— to the President of an iron and steel concern, who
took him into employ as Treasurer and gave him a block of
shares. The alien enemy <span class="nowrap">P——</span> seemed to get along
pretty well for a time, but got in wrong with the firm
through a transaction which they did not approve. The
Secretary of the firm was very friendly to the alien enemy
P——. This Secretary was found to be connected by
marriage with one of the foremost electrical inventors of
the age, who had been very active in the development of
devices for our Army and Navy. Observe that this man
was a particular confidant of the unnaturalized German
P——, formerly of the German Army.</p>

<p>The original Mr. <span class="nowrap">S——</span>, who had acted as a voucher
for <span class="nowrap">P——</span>, had stated that he could get money to the
enemy, through the War Department. His father had
stock in a concern which was taken over by our Alien
Enemy Custodian. The not very mysterious Mr. <span class="nowrap">P——</span>
removed during June, 1918, leaving New York without
notifying the Chief of Police, as is required. He was
located doing business in an office in down-town New York
City as a broker, although his name was not listed in the
telephone directory. He was apparently trading under the
name of L. P. &amp; Company. The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. has found that
his mother is living in Germany and is reported to be
wealthy. <span class="nowrap">P——</span> has pretended that he was a traveling
salesman, which he was not. He endeavored to avoid meeting
people whom he knew while residing in northern New
Jersey. His residence was located in another state.</p>

<p>This case also shows how much sometimes may be discovered
by way of a tangled skein, even if no one is shot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
at sunrise. Mr. <span class="nowrap">S——</span> was visited at his office by an
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. man, who did not make himself known. He was
very much exercised over the fact that the place of his
business was known. He requested that his personal and
business relations should not be linked up together. Mr.
P—— is still in business in New York, no doubt waiting
for the next war.</p>

<p>Northern New Jersey was the field for many reports of
mysterious signal lights along the seacoast. Most of these
stories had small foundation, but at least one of these
would have come to something had not the Armistice cut
off the investigation. In this case, operators were sometimes
out for hours watching for the flashlights, and once
a squad of military reserves lay on watch practically all
night around a suspect’s house. They discovered night
signaling with a search-light and calcium-light at different
places over the Northeastern part of Bergen County, and
there seemed to be evidence of a system of signaling extending
from the Hudson River in New Jersey, across
Bergen County up into the Ramapo Mountains and the
Greenwood Lake district in New York. The observers
used surveying transits for spotting the lights, and by
means of this instrument, were able to obtain the angles of
the lights. These angles were then plotted, and the intersection
points gave approximately the location of the light.
This work resulted in the location of three individuals,
but at about this time the Armistice ended the signals and
the apparent necessity for watching them. There had been
discovered, however, some real foundation for a signal light
scare in this district.</p>

<p>Ridgewood had another strange case—a German who
claimed to be so sick that he could not live long—who
wanted to go back home in order to die in the dear old
Fatherland. Medical examination showed that he probably
would die sometime, but the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. examination led to
the refusal of his passports, it being believed that he might
carry something to Germany besides fatal disease.</p>

<p>Newark, the capital of Northern New Jersey Division,
had a very baffling pro-German case where it was difficult
to find anything on which a legal prosecution could be
brought. The facts were such as resulted in the social<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
ostracism of the family, so that their disloyalty, after all,
had a certain punishment, although it did not fit the
crime. <span class="nowrap">H——</span> and his wife were members of a Presbyterian
Church, and were so openly pro-German that everybody
ceased to have anything to do with them. At a
luncheon given at the <span class="nowrap">H——</span> household the favors distributed
to a dozen ladies consisted of nice pictures of
Kaiser Wilhelm. One of the guests then suggested that
it would be a nice thing to sing the Star Spangled Banner,
which did not please Mrs. <span class="nowrap">H——</span> at all. The head of
this household was educated in Germany, and married a
German woman whose relatives were high in the German
army. They had a daughter who was engaged to an
American, but the latter broke off the engagement on
account of the pro-Germanism of the <span class="nowrap">H——</span> family. The
social ostracism really amounted to isolation, so that it was
impossible to hear of any disloyal utterances which would
warrant governmental action, nor indeed any utterances
at all. The town was through with them.</p>

<p>Northern New Jersey probably has the laziest slacker in
the world. His name is <span class="nowrap">M——</span>, and at one time he resided
in New York. He had an Emergency Fleet classification
card, but only worked two or three days out of the
week and spent most of his time at home in bed. He
thought he would rather go South where the climate was
better. He was rated as so lazy that he was shifted from
one government job to another—and that certainly is
going some, in view of what is sometimes done in government
service. He was so lazy that he used to go to bed
with his shoes on, and would leave his light burning all
night because he was too tired to put it out. This champion
rester carried a registration card, but he had been given
limited service on account of calloused feet. From the
description of him, it is difficult to see how his feet got
calloused; but at least that is what the report says.</p>

<p>New Jersey had a very blood-curdling citizen who dwelt
in Newark under the name of H. <span class="nowrap">B——</span>. He carried an
American name although he was born in Italy about forty-two
years ago. He came to America thirty years ago,
when he was a small boy, in order to escape punishment
for having killed a priest. He never dared to return to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
Italy, but remained an alien in this country and an enemy
to about everything going. He was a very ardent I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.
man, and declared that there were enough I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. men
in the Army and outside to blow up the country if they
liked,—a very good example of the flourishing Bolshevik
element in America. Mr. <span class="nowrap">B——</span> claimed that he had
stabbed a detective in Providence, R. I., a year or so ago
during an I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. celebration; hence he did not like to
visit Providence either. He told how in another place he
had cut out a man’s intestines, and when asked if the man
died, remarked: “What in hell do you suppose I am here
for?” This pleasant gentleman often went to Paterson
and New York to attend I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. meetings there. He
hoped that “every —— —— soldier the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> sent over
would be blown up by submarines and drowned like rats,
and that if any did get across, he hoped the Germans
would choke or shoot them to death.” He said he would
like to get his fingers on President Wilson’s throat. It
was his pleasant practice to tear American flags from the
coats of persons wearing them. His home was searched,
and some clock-works were found without any dials and
hands, such as have been known to be used with bombs.
It seems that nothing was done with the bloodthirsty Mr.
B—— after all, and he is still at large.</p>

<p>In so complex an office as that of the Northern New Jersey
Division, which much resembles that of New York
City, Newark alone cleared over 9,013 cases, of which
twenty-five per cent were for the War Department, forty-five
per cent for the Department of Justice, other divisions
of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. work fifteen per cent, and original cases with
New Jersey A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. fifteen per cent. Most of this work
was for D.&nbsp;J., but there was much coöperation with officers
from Naval and Military Intelligence, not to mention the
local boards. This great division has a tangible record of
4,563 cases of the second class, those handled entirely in
local units, making a total of 13,576 cases sufficiently definite
in character to warrant a record. As to the actual
investigations, recorded and unrecorded, they would without
question bring up the total of northern New Jersey
cases above 30,000. They were from every point of the
compass and of every color of the rainbow.</p>

THE STORY OF PITTSBURGH</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Another Storm Center—Greatest Concentration of War
Work in the United States—The Tower of Babel and How
it was Held Safe—No I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. Need Apply.</p>
</div>

<p>Pittsburgh also was expected to be an alien storm center
when the United States declared war upon Germany. This
uneasiness was natural and to be expected. Most of our
great iron and steel plants were located there, and numerous
other important industries as well. These plants
were vital to our success in the war, as were the great
coal mines in the adjacent districts. It was felt on every
side that the enemy would strike here if he struck at all.
But the main cause for apprehension lay in the fact that
Pittsburgh had an enormous foreign population, especially
from countries of the central allies, and the presence of
this element in its industries was feared as a source of
dynamite, sabotage and labor troubles. The fact that Pittsburgh
and Western Pennsylvania throughout the war remained
practically free from labor disturbances and war
munition destruction, so troublesome in other sections,
was due to the splendid intelligence service rendered by
the American Protective League, in close coöperation with
the United States Department of Justice and Naval and
Military Intelligence Bureaus. The Smoky City sends in
a very clean report.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh operated the highest percentage on war work
of any district in the United States. It filled over sixty-five
per cent of all the steel contracts placed by the Ordnance
Department, in addition to the tremendous output
of munitions and other war materials for the Entente
Allies. It was estimated that the district was running
from sixty to seventy per cent on war work at the time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
of the Armistice, that at least 5,000 plants, many of them
mammoth in size, were filling Government orders, and over
one million employees were engaged in large part in helping
win the war. During the latter part of hostilities the
daily labor shortage was over 16,000. It was vital to the
United States and to the Entente Allies that the Pittsburgh
District should be permitted to conduct unmolested its
great industries of the war, and that this was possible was
due in a large measure to the American Protective League.</p>

<p>A few days after the war was declared, John W. Weibley,
a well known Pittsburgh business man, was asked to
organize a Division of the American Protective League in
the twenty-seven counties of Western Pennsylvania, comprising
the United States Western Judicial District. Mr.
Weibley conferred with Mr. Robert S. Judge, Special Agent
in Charge of the Bureau of Investigation, Department of
Justice, to learn if the Government was in need of such
an organization. When assured that it was, Mr. Weibley
began the formation of a branch for this district.</p>

<p>Representatives of the railroads and other important
corporations were called into conference and were asked
to coöperate, and within an amazingly short time the
American Protective League had active agents in every
county, township, city, town and village in the entire
district. In the case of Pittsburgh, the operating headquarters,
this plan of organization was worked out so
minutely that an active agent representing the League, and
in constant communication with it, was located in every
voting precinct, and where there were concentrations of
the foreign element, these agents were to be found in practically
every city block.</p>

<p>Mr. Weibley personally perfected and maintained from
Pittsburgh this network throughout the District. Mr.
Ralph B. Montgomery directed the work in Pittsburgh,
each ward being placed in charge of a captain who reported
to him, and each captain having his separate lieutenants
with agents in every election precinct. Mr. Raymond H.
Allen, assisted by Mr. William S. Masten, directed the
operation of the intelligence activities in the outlying
counties.</p>

<p>Frequent meetings of ward captains and district lieutenants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
were held to hear suggestions from representatives
of the Government. They were thus kept familiar
with the latest happenings and knew what precautions to
take to make their work effective.</p>

<p>The story of the Pittsburgh Division, as it is related in
these pages by its Chief, is the story of a program of
action, thoughtfully conceived, carefully and efficiently
executed, and successful beyond all expectations. Mr.
Weibley says in his report:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A splendid <i>esprit de corps</i> was maintained, as the organization
in Pittsburgh was limited to the least possible number in
membership, and all members were kept busy. Great care was
used in the selection of the men enrolled, and each applicant
was subjected to a rigid investigation. If he did not meet the
requirements, his application was rejected or placed on file to
provide material for future replacements when urgency demanded
it. As a result, the highest interest in the work was
maintained throughout the war period.</p>

<p>The Pittsburgh district being the most important manufacturing,
munition, fuel and chemical center in the country, was
largely dependent for its labor upon foreigners, many of whom
came from countries at war with us. It therefore was imperative
that many of our operatives should be of diverse nationalities
and able to speak many tongues. As an illustration, it
was estimated that at the beginning of the war fully fifty per
cent of the Austrians in the United States were at work in
vital coal mines, coke works, steel mills and other industrial
plants within a radius of 50 miles of Pittsburgh. This naturally
made the alien menace a grave one, but so intensive was
the organization of the League that not an important industrial
operation in the great district was without one or more
of the League agents as active employes. In fact, intimate
connection was maintained with every alien gathering or meeting
place, and nothing of moment was planned that the League
officials were not soon familiar with. In fact, in one of the
largest industrial concerns, the principal official was chief of
a league unit, and many of his trusted employes were his active
associates.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh industrial concerns, vitally interested in meeting
the Government’s demands for constantly increasing output of
war material, quickly solved the question of finances, and the
League had ample funds to meet every requirement. This
made possible a highly efficient office organization and a suite
of offices on the fourth floor of the St. Nicholas Building,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
which permitted the Department of Justice and Army and
Navy Intelligence Bureaus also to locate quarters there,
giving a compact working organization reaching every branch
of the service and promoting that intimate contact and close
coöperation which assured success. This reciprocal arrangement
was especially effective in the case of the Department of
Justice, which, under the operation of Mr. Judge, rendered and
was rendered assistance on all occasions.</p>

<p>Director Charles B. Prichard, of the Pittsburgh Department
of Public Safety, recognized the possibilities of effective coöperation
at the beginning, and there was not a moment when
the patrolmen and municipal detectives did not do everything
possible to promote the success of the League’s activities. This
spirit of patriotic coöperation on the part of the municipal
authorities was constantly maintained through the friendliness
and enthusiasm of Robert J. Alderdice, superintendent
of police; Magistrate Walter J. Lloyd and Commissioners of
Police Dye, Kane, Johnson and Calhoun. Pittsburgh certainly
was well policed. In all, the League maintained constantly
throughout the trying period over 2,000 active operatives.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of this far-reaching organization was revealed
in the complete absence of those disturbances which
had been feared. At the outbreak of war, troops had been
located at bridges and important public works, but the thorough
manner in which the League ferreted out those who were
willing to foment trouble soon rendered unnecessary the guarding
of industrial plants by soldiers or police. There were no
interruptions to the enormous output of munitions and manufactured
material, nor were there any accidents, explosions or
labor troubles traced to agents of the enemy. In the Pittsburgh
division alone, over 25,000 cases were investigated, and
every person upon whom the least suspicion had been cast
was soon rendered powerless to do harm. Every effort was
made to eliminate troubles by preventing alien sympathizers
from perfecting their plans. No meetings where incendiary
talk could be fostered were permitted to continue, and it was
not long before those who had trouble in mind realized that to
continue their purpose would only lead to their own downfall
and also that of their followers. The record of the League is
a tribute to the wisdom of this preventive policy.</p>

<p>It was feared that because of the large proportion of foreigners
in the Pittsburgh district, the wide diversity of languages
spoken, and the great illiteracy among certain of the nationalities,
there would be great difficulty in securing proper observance
of the Selective Service registration regulations.
During the Civil War, there had been serious draft riots in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
Pittsburgh, when the percentage of foreigners and of illiteracy
was much less. The American Protective League, in coöperation
with Mr. Judge, gave the widest publicity in every possible
way to the plans for the registration and the penalty
for failure to comply. The result of this work of preparation
was that the registration was effected without disorder, and
there were no occasions for wholesale arrests to bring evaders
or possible evaders to justice. In fact, the League’s policy
was to prevent trouble by advising those inclined to resent
the Government’s call, and to make no arrests until other
means failed. It was only necessary for an American Protective
League operative to appear in open court on one occasion.</p>

<p>I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. propaganda was never permitted to take root.
Work to eliminate this menace occupied a large amount of
the League’s attention. A well organized scheme of the Socialists
to evade the Selective Service Law was broken up
when a prominent radical and anarchist, a ringleader in the
movement, was taken from a meeting he was about to address
and compelled to register. The facts that the plans of the
scheme were so well known to the League cooled the ardor of
the malcontents.</p>

<p>The division had considerable trouble with a Jewish family
which used every artifice to protect a lad of selective service
age and prevent his being taken into the army. They finally
succeeded in spiriting him away, but he was convicted of
evading the draft, and by pressure on his family, who were
placed under bond to return him, he was brought back to
Pittsburgh, sent to jail for six months and then inducted into
the army.</p>

<p>A number of Italians, through one of their societies, conceived
a plan to make money by filling in questionnaires to
enable evasion of selective service. Two ringleaders were
arrested, and the chief of the society afterward rendered the
League valuable service in preventing labor disturbances. The
League also uncovered a scheme of a few unscrupulous lawyers
to extort money from men on the ground that their advice
would permit them to evade the law. Arrests were not necessary,
as the warning of the League of the consequences of any
continuance of the practice was sufficient.</p>

<p>The League was able to break the backbone of a dangerous
plan of German propaganda through an international organization
known as the Geneva Association, whose members were
principally alien enemies. The officers were arrested and
placed under bond for trial.</p>

<p>One very dangerous draft evader and conscientious objector<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
was arrested and court-martialed after considerable trouble.
He was Walter L. Hirschberg, a student at the University of
Pittsburgh. He registered for selective service, but wrote and
sent to his draft board his “declaration of rights,” as he viewed
them, and maintained such an attitude of defiance toward the
Government that it was decided to investigate him. In the
meantime he disappeared and was traced to New York, where
he was placed under observation. He was detained in a locked
room in a hotel until sufficient evidence could be obtained
against him, but was so shrewd and resourceful that he outwitted
his captors and made his escape. It was suspected that
he had gone to Chicago, and a Pittsburgh operative went there
to find him. The use of commendable strategy secured his
arrest and his return to Pittsburgh at the point of a revolver.
Although he condemned war as organized murder, he carried
a loaded revolver and blackjack for emergencies! The details
of his escape and flight read like a thrilling story of Sherlock
Holmes. As an instance of his resourcefulness and quick wit,
he related that when he arrived at the depot in Chicago, he
picked up a newspaper to learn quickly the lay of the land.
In flaming headlines he discovered that Chicago police that
morning were making wholesale arrests of all young men
without registration cards. He had none. He espied a woman
with a babe and a large traveling case, and politely offered to
assist her by carrying the valise. When he was approached
by an officer and requested to show his card, he quickly retorted,
“Oh, you are too late. You can see that this is my wife
and child.” He was allowed to leave the depot and go unmolested.
He went into hiding until the scare was over. Hirschberg
was sent by a court-martial at Camp Lee to the Atlanta
prison for twenty years.</p>
</div>

<p>“Pittsburgh had some amusing incidents,” says the
Chief who has been so freely quoted, and he has included
several of them in his report:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There was little bootlegging as liquor dealers endeavored to
comply with the law forbidding the sale of intoxicants to
soldiers in uniform or within restricted areas adjacent to army
camps. One negro was suspected, and upon being approached
by an operative, readily agreed to sell a quart of “cold tea”
for $9.00. The operative bought—and then arrested the negro.
When the “cold tea” was tested, it was found to be just what
the negro said it was—cold tea!</p>

<p>An alien enemy refused to register and was taken to the
League headquarters for intensive examination. The operative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
was called to the telephone on an urgent message just as he
entered headquarters. He hastened to the telephone, leaving
his prisoner where he could not escape. When he had finished,
he discovered his prisoner missing. It transpired that another
operative had come into headquarters, and the prisoner had
asked him where aliens registered. The operative asked
“Why?” and when he was informed that the man wished to
register, he obligingly agreed to accompany him to the United
States Marshal’s office. He was chagrined to find that he had
deprived his fellow operative of a case.</p>

<p>A peculiar case came under the notice of the League. A
Russian of draft age, whose father and brothers and sisters
were naturalized, claimed exemption on the ground that the
father had not taken out his citizenship papers until after he,
the subject, had passed his majority, and he had never lost his
Russian citizenship. The objector was sent to jail, but the
decision was rendered that his point was well taken and he
was released.</p>

<p>The League did a wonderful work in reconstructing families,
returning wayward sons to sorrowing mothers, and in rehabilitating
young men whose patriotism and fidelity to duty
were lukewarm. In correcting and preventing trouble the
American Protective League performed a splendid service to
the Government.</p>

THE STORY OF BOSTON</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Massachusetts Somewhat Mixed in Safety Measures—Early
Embarrassment of Riches—Brief History of A. P.
L.—Organization and Its Success—Stories of the Trail.</p>
</div>

<p>After A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. began to reach out into a wide development
by reason of the hard work of the National Directors at
Washington, D.&nbsp;J. in that town began to cry for more. It
sent out to all its special agents and local offices a circular
explaining the great assistance which the League was capable
of rendering the Government, and asked the assignment of a
special agent as an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. detail in each bureau locality.
This circular went out on February 6, 1918, and Boston
received a copy duly, as well as the request of the Provost
Marshal General to the Governor of Massachusetts for aid
in selective service matters. At that time there was no division
of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. organized in Boston. A few days later
the Massachusetts Committee of Public Safety, which had
been organized and active ever since the beginning of the
war, was asked to interest itself to the extent of having
some good man start a Boston division of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. The
latter matter was slow in development because of the extent
and thoroughness of the earlier state organization. The latter
had been taking care of the food, fuel and other administrative
work in assistance to the Government. The feeling
was that it might be better to enlarge the Committee of
Public Safety than to start any new body which might be a
source of misunderstanding and friction.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice work in Boston during the
early days of the war had not been satisfactory. Boston, so
far from being all Puritan, has in reality one of the most
mixed populations in the country. There was some feeling
against the Department of Justice in Boston, and some feeling
also against any new body which proposed to link up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
closely with that arm of the Government. D.&nbsp;J. had been
handling for itself the alien enemy, anti-military and propaganda
work. Yet very early in the game D.&nbsp;J. was overworked
in Boston, as it had been in every other great city in
America, and it really needed help. There were a great
many thinking men who believed that it could be much relieved
by the well-organized support of the banking, real
estate, industrial and commercial activities of the city, as had
been the case all over the United States where A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. divisions
had been created.</p>

<p>Still another embarrassment, however, slowed up the early
activities of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in Boston. That city having in its
population many French Canadians, Irish, and so forth, of
the Catholic faith, had developed a sort of Church problem,
and there had become somewhat active the organization
known as the “A. P. A.”—whose initials are somewhat
close to those of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. Many thought that confusion
between the two organizations would result. There had been,
moreover, in this state of independent thought, a great many
other “Leagues” of this, that and the other sort; so that
many felt that Boston had about enough leagues as matters
then stood.</p>

<p>At about this time Mr. W. Rodman Peabody of the Committee
of Public Safety pointed out to Washington the efficient
manner in which Mr. Endicott had organized that
committee throughout the State. There was a local committee
of safety in every town, and also a state-wide machine
organizing the banking, real estate and other important
business activities. He suggested that instead of a division
of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L., there ought to be a sub-organization “organized
by the Committee of Public Safety at the request of the
Department of Justice.” It was understood that this minor
organization should have the general features of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
and should act as the Massachusetts branch of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. A
list of good names was suggested of persons suitable for the
organization as thus outlined.</p>

<p>Mr. Elting of the National Directors, however, made the
point that an arrangement of this kind would have a
tendency to discredit or to disintegrate the League in other
cities. The Attorney-General also was opposed to any organization
which did not show the exact status of a purely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
volunteer body, as had been done in all other parts of the
United States.</p>

<p>Mr. Peabody still wanted the Committee of Public Safety
to appear as the parent or controlling body, and a lot of
valuable time was wasted over this tweedle-dee argument. A
compromise was effected, and on April 15, 1918, the National
Directors had advice that the Massachusetts organization was
hiring offices, and assumed that the work had begun and
that Boston would copy as nearly as possible the form of
letterhead used by A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L., putting the names of the National
Directors on the left-hand side and substituting the words
“Protective League.” Underneath that was to appear the
legend: “Organized by the Massachusetts Public Safety
Committee under the Direction of the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Department of
Justice, Bureau of Investigation.” Boston expressed the
belief that Washington would not be able to tell the difference
between this organization and any other so far as loyalty
and efficiency were concerned, although sensible of the
Washington feeling that Massachusetts was starting a year
late and might be suspected of lack in coöperation.</p>

<p>All concerned having thus been satisfied, Massachusetts
began A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. work a trifle late in the game, but none the
less proceeded to show that it could produce as effective an
organization as any other in the country. Assistant Chief
H. E. Trumbull makes his report on the regulation A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
blanks and letterheads, and adds the following data as to
the later organization of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Samuel Wolcott was appointed Chief, and we took two
offices at 45 Milk Street, in the same building with the Department
of Justice. Mr. Trumbull, then a volunteer operative
with the Department proper, consented to help with the new
organization, and Mr. John B. Hanrahan was appointed by
the Department of Justice as a special agent to oversee the
work of the new organization.</p>

<p>A few weeks later we found that the work was too great to
handle in such small quarters, and about the first of May contracted
for half of the eighth floor of the building, the Department
of Justice taking the other half. At this time Mr.
Trumbull was appointed Assistant Chief.</p>

<p>As a nucleus of the state organization, we took the names
of the men who had been doing volunteer work for the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
States Attorney’s office, and we proceeded to send out to these
men the work that came in their territory, and as they proved
satisfactory, appointed them as inspectors of a certain district
and gave them directions whereby they organized.</p>

<p>About July first, the League took over from the Department
the handling of all draft matters, the Department loaning to
the League two special agents to supervise and the League furnishing
all the men for the actual work.</p>

<p>We think the strongest recommendation we can give of our
loyalty and interest is the approximate number of cases handled
from April 11, 1918, to February 1, 1919, which number amounts
to about 5,000, with about 4,000 draft cases under the Selective
Service Act.</p>

<p>On or about October first, Mr. Wolcott resigned for the purpose
of taking up active duties with the Army, and Mr. John
W. Hannigan was appointed Chief in his place.</p>

<p>The relations of the League with the Department have been
of the closest, and there has never been any friction. Special
Agent Kelleher has stated that if it had not been for the
activities of the League, it would have been absolutely impossible
for his office to handle the great volume of work.</p>
</div>

<p>Once in its swing, Boston Division proceeded to do as
Boston always does, and to work in thorough and efficient
fashion. A detailed statement of the work for Department
of Justice covers 525 cases of alien enemy activities, 292
cases under the Espionage act, one case of treason, seven of
sabotage, eleven of interference with the draft, 128 cases of
propaganda, twenty cases of radicals and socialists, seven
naturalization cases, and other investigations amounting
to 484.</p>

<p>For reasons above outlined, the division did little in food
and fuel, and there was not much to do for the Navy. There
were seventy-seven cases of character and loyalty investigations,
331 passport cases, and 262 cases that had to do with
war insurance and like matters.</p>

<p>A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. was, as usual, of great use to the War Department.
The division conducted 514 investigations for local
boards, examined 4,000 slacker raid cases, as well as fifteen
gentlemen who did not know whether to work or fight. There
were 1,908 applicants for overseas service who were investigated,
as well as 510 applicants for commissions. The division
deserves compliments for its steady and intelligent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
administration of the whole range of the complicated problems
that rose out of the war situation.</p>

<p>There were all sorts of curious cases which came up in
Boston as in other cities, which show alien artlessness or
slacker subterfuges much as they appear elsewhere, as well
as a certain occasional informality in regard to the observance
of the ordinary civil laws. For instance, one does not
recall the name of Edward Burkhart as one of the occupants
of the Mayflower on its arrival; neither does Mr. Burkhart
seem to have been fully possessed of Puritan principles, for
it was alleged that he had been dishonorably discharged from
the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Navy, was dishonorably living with a woman who
was not his wife, and had dishonorably failed to register
for the draft. As Mr. Burkhart was hiding out somewhere,
an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operative was put on his trail. He went to the
house where Burkhart was living and told the woman in
the case that she was doing wrong in covering up the whereabouts
of Burkhart. He added that he believed the man was
in the house or would come back to the house, in spite of all
she had said. That was at three o’clock in the afternoon, and
the operative concluded to sit in the house and wait to see
what would happen, all exits being guarded by other operatives.
Nothing did happen until 9:15 that night, although
the house was searched. At last, up in the attic, a small
blind space was found where the electric light wires went up
to the roof. A flash light here illuminated the dark interior—and
disclosed Mr. Burkhart resting rather uncomfortably
on the cross beams, where he had been since early that afternoon—something
of a Spartan, if not much of a Puritan.
It was found that he was twenty-five years of age and not
thirty-seven. It was also found that he had the classification
card belonging to another man, whereupon he was accused
of failure to file his questionnaire. On December 30,
he was brought before the Grand Jury, found guilty and
sentenced to East Cambridge jail.</p>

<p>Another gentleman, Mr. Ralph <span class="nowrap">E——</span>, when he filled out
his questionnaire, swore that he was a married man and had
a wife and child dependent upon him. It was discovered
that the woman was not his wife. The man consulted the
partner of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. inspector—the two being members
of the same law firm—in professional capacity. Here, therefore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
was a question of ethics involving the privilege of a
confession made to an attorney and also the oath taken to
the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. The two law partners called in Mr. <span class="nowrap">E——</span>
and gave him good advice about the crime of perjury. As
the man did what he could to square up matters, it was
decided to let that part of his case drop. He was not sent
to prison.</p>

<p>Mr. Herbert <span class="nowrap">C——</span> had an ambition to go across as a
member of the American Red Cross and had good recommendations.
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L., however, discovered that he was an
alleged dope fiend. He did not go with the Red Cross.</p>

<p>Peter <span class="nowrap">R——</span>, of a town near Boston, while arguing with
two men about the war, made a few such casual statements
as “To hell with Liberty Bonds,” “To hell with Thrift
Stamps,” “The Government is no good,” “I will not fight
for this country,” “I will not register,” “I am going back
to my own country, Russia,” and “The whole United States
Government be damned.” This man was brought before the
Assistant United States District Attorney from the police
court, but the attorney declined to prosecute and said that
Peter was only playful. He did not think that a private
trial could be used in a Federal prosecution. Most excellent!
Obviously, it is the spirit that killeth, and the letter
that giveth life!</p>

<p>A Mr. <span class="nowrap">C——</span> swore he had a wife and child dependent
on him, and so he ought not to be asked to fight. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
found out that he had spent ten thousand dollars the year
before, that his father gave him all he wished, that he was a
Boston clubman, that he was not engaged in any productive
industry. Held to the grand jury in five thousand dollars
bail.</p>

<p>A man by the name of <span class="nowrap">J——</span> was reported on November
14 to have made disloyal and pro-German remarks. Two
days later, three affidavits were before the Assistant District
Attorney. In this case the attorney ruled that although the
men had a clean cut case against him, there was no need
to prosecute him if he had been warned. Indeed, why
annoy an alien?</p>

<p>Boston is well known in the matter of tea parties. An
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. officer was taking tea with a navy officer on board
ship in Boston harbor, and the latter complained that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
men were getting too much cold tea on their shore leave.
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. took it up with the Naval Intelligence, and within
a week a man was taken in custody for selling such beverages
to men in uniform.</p>

<p>Mr. Charles D. Milkowicz, or some such name, was alleged
to dance in happiness at the report of any German victory.
It was his custom to fire any employe in the factory where
he was foreman, if the employe showed any pro-American
tendencies. Once he said regarding the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> flag, “Get
that damned flag out of the way.” He used to wear an iron
cross stick pin up to April 6, 1917. He was a member of
the German Club, and used to buy silver nails for the Hindenburg
statue which they maintained at that club, such
nails retailing for a dollar a throw, all for the good of the
Kaiser. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. started an investigation which showed that
this man seemed to be uncertain whether he came from
Russia or Germany and was equally indefinite as to his age.
He was not registered as an alien enemy, and was charged
with falsifying his questionnaire as well as violating Section
3 of the Espionage Act. The Assistant <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Attorney handling
alien enemy matters in Massachusetts refused to act
in this case. So far as known, the attorney is still in office,
and Mr. Milkowicz is still in Boston.</p>

<p>Mr. Hans <span class="nowrap">D——</span>, a German waiter in Boston, belonged
to a German club where considerable advance news of German
operations circulated. Mr. <span class="nowrap">D——</span> said he sent money
to Germany; said that Germany would win the war; drank
to the health of the Kaiser on hearing that an American ship
had been torpedoed. In short, Mr. <span class="nowrap">D——</span> ran quite true
to form in all ways. A photograph was found which looked
like him in a German uniform—he must have been a German
officer, because they found in his possession a half dozen
spoons which he had stolen in New England, in default of
better opportunity in Belgium. At least he was prosecuted
for larceny and was fined $15.00. Later his reputation was
found to be so bad as a propagandist that he was interned
on a presidential warrant.</p>

<p>It occurred to the fertile brain of Mr. Julius Bongraber
that a varied spelling of his name might prove useful to him
in times of draft. Sometimes he wrote his name as Graber,
sometimes as Van Graber, and sometimes as Julius V. Gaber.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
His classification card named him as G. V. Gaber. When
interrogated as to all these matters, he admitted that the
initial “G” ought to have been “Y,” because that was the
way Yulius was pronounced, anyhow, in his country. At
the same time he left a card over his door signed J. V. Gaber.
He declared that he was a German, also an Austrian, also a
neutral, but had sympathies with Russia. To others he said
that his name was Von Gaber; that he was an alien, but
would go where he liked. He had taken out first citizenship
papers, but had registered for return with the Austria-Hungarian
Consul. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. got this multifold party on
the carpet, but on his statement that he intended to go to
New York, the prosecution seems to have been dropped,
although the dossier was forwarded to New York after him.</p>

<p>There was a draft evader in Boston by the name of
R——, who did not file his questionnaire. He was found
at his home by an agent of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. and agreed to accompany
the latter. It was the intention of the operative to turn over
his man to a policeman, but policemen seemed to be rare in
Boston, for in two miles not one was sighted. The draft
evader then evaded yet more, and was not found for several
days thereafter. The man’s mother, however, when found,
averred she had not seen her son for two months. A plain
patriotic talk was made to her with the result that after a
while, she found the said son and turned him over to the
authorities for service in the army.</p>

<p>Boston Division in one case revoked the credentials which
it had issued to an operative. The man’s name was Oscar
F——, and the position seemed to go to his head. He took
to borrowing money right and left, once getting as high as
fifty dollars on a touch of one of the special agents. He
admitted that he was probably the best secret service agent
in the country, and told people he was getting $3,000 a year
and expenses. After that he usually touched his listener for
$5.00. Oscar was doing well until they let him out. His
name ended in “ski.”</p>

<p>Boston, being near the Northern seaboard, heard of a good
many cases of mysterious light signals. One operative in the
Lynn district was sure he had seen dots and dashes coming
across the bay at night in the approved fashion of mysterious
night signals. They put a telegrapher on the case but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
could not make out the message. At one o ’clock in the morning
four tried men and true of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. rowed out with
muffled oars to an anchored yacht which seemed to be the
place from which the light signals appeared. They found
five pairs of feet pointing to the zenith. Calling upon the
feet to surrender, they boarded the yacht and explanations
followed. It appeared that the five yachtsmen had had a
hard day’s sail and had decided to remain on board ship
over night. The flashes of light which had so aroused the
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. men were nothing more nor less than the reflection
of a shore light on the glass of a porthole as the boat rolled
and swayed in the ripples of the bay.</p>

<p>Next to mysterious signal lights, wireless stations have produced
as many flivvers for the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. as anything else.
Inspector <span class="nowrap">T——</span> insisted that there was a house in his district
which ought to be searched, because he was satisfied it
had a wireless plant. As he had no proof, he could not obtain
a search warrant. Mr. Endicott, at the office of the Food
Administration, gave him a sugar warrant, stating that that
would let him into the house, and that he might get some
information. Inspector <span class="nowrap">T——</span> went to the house with a
club in one hand and the warrant in the other; searched the
house from garret to basement, but found no wireless. While
poking around in one of the corners, however, he did discover
eighty pounds of sugar, which, being overweight, he
promptly confiscated.</p>

<p>Soon after the forming of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in Boston, a man
came in with a carrier pigeon which he was sure was a
mysterious messenger of some sort. It was a beautiful white
bird that had dark dots and dashes all over the inside of
both wings. The chief was all wrought up about this and
regretted that he had not been taught the Morse code in early
life. He therefore took the man and the bird over to the
office of Military Intelligence, where they unravel, decipher
and decode all sorts of things. The Major in command was
very cordial, and he also examined the bird carefully. In
his belief the dots and dashes on the wings were of importance,
but he could not quite read them all. He sent for
the code expert of the Signal Corps. Who shall say that
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. cannot run down any sort of clew? The code expert
of the Signal Corps also examined the bird carefully, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
at first could not make it out. Then he touched one of the
dots with the point of his pencil. It turned out to be a perfectly
good cootie, which still possessed powers of locomotion.</p>

<p>Throughout the war, New England was, always, one of
the nerve centers of the United States. A great many munition
factories were at work there day and night. The atmosphere
was tense all the time; war was in the eyes and ears of
the people. But let no man believe New England anything
but American. Whatever her population to-day, her leadership
is American and only American and always will be
such. Boston and her environs, the entire state of Massachusetts,
the entire section of New England, went into the
war from the first word. No part of America is saner or
safer; no part was better guided and guarded by local agencies
of defense. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. was accepted as one of these,
certainly not to the regret of any man concerned.</p>

THE STORY OF CLEVELAND</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Astonishing Figures of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. Activities in a Great Manufacturing
City—Sabotage, Bolshevism and Treason—I.
W. W. and Kindred Radical Propaganda—The Saving of
a City.</p>
</div>

<p>Once more we find occasion to revise the popular estimate
of a supposedly well-known American community. No one
would think of staid, steady, even-going Cleveland as anything
but a place of prosperity and peace. At a rough estimate,
before the Cleveland report came in, one would have
said that possibly that city might report a total of ten or
fifteen thousand cases of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. investigations. As a matter
of fact, the Cleveland total is over sixty thousand! And
yet, the Cleveland Chief in his report calls attention to the
large amount of war supplies manufactured in his district,
and says: “We were a hot-bed of Socialism and pro-Germanism,
but not one dollar’s worth of material was
lost.”</p>

<p>Cleveland Division was organized in May, 1917, with a
personnel of 1,008—Mr. Arch C. Klunph, Chief, six Assistant
Chiefs, seven Departmental Inspectors, an office staff
and eighteen companies. There were also one women’s company
and about five hundred unattached operatives; a total
personnel of 1,551.</p>

<p>As the type of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. service varied in different cities,
it may be interesting to other cities to note the character of
work the Cleveland division was called upon to do. The list
of investigations covers many heads: Failure to register,
failure to entrain, and deserters from service, 5,356; failure
to submit questionnaire, 2,100; failure to report for physical
examination, 3,100; claims for exemption, 2,500; seditious
literature, 50; seditious and treasonable utterances or pro-German
cases, 7,113; loyalty investigations for Army, Navy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
Red Cross, Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A., etc., 1,746; wireless outfits, 40; enemy
agents or spies, 363; I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W., Socialist, W.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;U. and
Bolsheviki, 1,529; industrial sabotage, 318; Liberty Bond
slackers, 500. Total number of men apprehended and examined
on slacker raids, estimated, 36,000. Total—60,715.</p>

<p>In addition to the foregoing, the Cleveland division has
rendered a large amount of service in investigating cases of
violations of food, fuel, electric light and gasless Sunday
regulations; cases for the National Council of Defense; registration
of male and female enemy aliens (approximately
5,000); work of <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Marshal’s office; work of Naturalization
Bureau by secret investigations of applicants for citizenship;
Red Cross overseas work; Socialist cases; details for
War Work plants. There also were regular weekly details
of volunteer workers with automobiles to assist the Police
Department.</p>

<p>As to definite preventive measures, the Chief points out
several instances: the stopping of manufacture of a fountain
pen which would explode on being opened; the choking off
of the establishment of a high-power wireless plant on the
shore of Lake Erie; the discharge of countless German workmen
in factories producing food for the Army; the confiscation
of models and plans of American battleships and submarines,
and literature found in the hands of German
propagandists.</p>

<p>In May, 1918, an express company notified Cleveland
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. that they were called upon to issue money orders
to an unusual number of Germans, who claimed that they
were returning to their homes in Russia. The League captured
twenty-three men, all claiming to live in Russia, although
plainly German in appearance, and speaking that
language in talking with one another. Three men left for
Chicago, but were apprehended by wire at the railroad terminal
in Chicago. This was a concerted movement to get
as many Germans as possible back into Russia.</p>

<p>Cleveland, being one of the largest cities of the United
States, and having also one of the largest percentages of
foreign population, naturally indeed was a hot-bed for Socialism,
I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. work and Bolshevism, although such had
not been the general reputation of the city. These organizations
held regular meetings, often with speeches of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
most dangerous character. At most of them, there was an
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operative noting all that was done and said.</p>

<p>Cleveland Division covered a population of over a million,
and that in one of the four largest war working centers in
the nation. It is a very proud claim to say that not one
dollar was lost to the nation. The Chief points out that this
statement is the more astonishing because there were made
in Cleveland a long list of military supplies: Air-planes,
wings and parts; ammunitions, clothing, trucks, and the hundred
other materials for use in the Army and Navy. There
were three hundred and eighty-six plants in Cuyahoga County
engaged in ordnance work, and there were employed in
these plants 1,218 workmen. These ordnance plants had contracts
amounting to $175,000,000. Motor transportation
plants, making trucks, trailers, axles, forms, etc., had a series
of contracts totaling $88,000,000. There were fifty plants
engaged in air-craft production, and twenty making clothing,
not to mention three large shipyards, all busy practically
day and night. That means work! Figures like this are
serious. It is no cheap flattery to say to the men who are
responsible for the safety of these vast industrial concerns
that their record is a more than marvelous one. It is no
wonder that there is the best of feeling between Cleveland
Division and the Department of Justice, Police Department
and all the allied administrations of the law. It is not necessary
to print the letters of appreciation from any of these.</p>

<p>The Chief says that the most of the active work covered
a period of about fifteen months. The cases handled monthly
approximated four thousand. Obviously it is impossible to
report sixty thousand, or four thousand, or one thousand
cases, but some of the Cleveland specials are too interesting
to leave aside. It is regrettable that they must be abbreviated.</p>

<p>On December 1, 1917, Dorothy <span class="nowrap">A——</span>, a nice Cleveland
girl, was selling Liberty Bonds for the Y. W. C. A. on a
partial payment basis, which did not seem quite right. Dorothy
was hard to find, but she admitted, when found, that
she was selling these bonds because she needed the money
herself. The mortgage on the old home was about to be foreclosed,
and she had taken this method of getting what money
she could. It was in truth the case of a young girl driven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
desperate by circumstances. The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. first got her a
good position; second, advanced the money to pay off the
mortgage on the home, she to pay them back in monthly
installments; and third, found the people to whom she had
sold the bonds, and returned the money of which she had
fraudulently deprived them. This girl remained clean and
straight, and as a culmination of the case she married a
young soldier, whom she met through the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L., who
later did his bit in France. We do not know of a prettier bit
in the history of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. than this.</p>

<p>On March 2, 1918, A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. ran down another one of those
cruel rumors against the Red Cross which have been started
by pro-German women for the most part. This rumor was
first circulated by a young woman, and is of a nature which
can not be put into print. The girl, when found, confessed
that she was guilty. She also confessed that she was hitting
the high spots in the city, having left a country home to get
acquainted with the bright lights. The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. did not kick
this woman down and out, either, but gave her a hand-up.
Two weeks later she came to the Division Office with tears
in her eyes, apologized for the false rumors which she had
set going, and implored that she might be allowed to do
something for the office of the division.</p>

<p>A war plant making aeroplane parts kept turning out
defective work. The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. put a woman operative in the
factory. She chanced to be a young woman of a wealthy
family, accustomed to the luxury of a beautiful home, but
she took to the overalls and dirty work as a duck does to
water. She was in the factory three weeks, located the
trouble, and it was adjusted.</p>

<p>A telephone call reported that a house was being burglarized.
An A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. man at the phone remembered that a
deserter had been sought for at that number. In thirty
minutes the house was surrounded. They did not catch the
deserter, but they did get the burglar.</p>

<p>A dangerous type of service was the raiding of I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.
headquarters. Sometimes these were boarding houses where
thirty or forty of these people would be gathered together.
When such a place was surrounded, the suspects would pour
out of the windows into the arms of the operatives. This
meant occasional fights, and there was danger in the work,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
but there was no case where loss of life was experienced.</p>

<p>An interesting fact of Cleveland war work was that developed
by examination of the draughting rooms in the large
plants. In some of these plants the entire draughting force
was not only German by descent but pro-German in sentiment.
It has often been said that part of German propaganda
was to get men in factories where they could get blue-prints
of all of our machinery. In November, 1917, the
League was advised that a draughtsman of a ship-building
company was very pro-German, and it was said that the
foreman in charge would hire only Germans. Constant
surveillance was ordered, but it was as late as June, 1918,
before this man was found making derogatory remarks about
our Army. He was found to have been an officer in the
German Reserves. He was jailed. Many letters were found
on him sufficient to warrant his internment.</p>

<p>As though I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.’s were not sufficiently dangerous,
operatives were once asked to arrest a colored slacker who
worked for a lion-tamer. The latter, a woman, gave the
operatives a tip that her assistant ought to be looked into.
He was finally caught at the time when he was transferring
the lions from the performing ring to their traveling cages,
but that did not stop the operatives. After he got the doors
locked he was taken to the Federal Building and inducted
into the Service, where his courage will be put to good
service.</p>

<p>Here are some familiar pro-German statements, this time
uttered by one A. <span class="nowrap">C——</span>, who was running an advertising
agency. At one time he said that “the war would be
ended by January 1, because German training was better
than ours—that we should not believe the lies about Germans
killing babies—everyone knows that America is going
to lose the war—that this is no war for Democracy—that
there is no Democracy in America.” Indicted. Guilty. Interned.
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.</p>

<p>Cleveland had its own troubles with evaders and slackers,
and it took many cleverly laid plans to catch some of them.
These are some of the methods. After locating where a suspect
lived who was hard to find, a man would appear next
day as one of the solicitors of the City Directory whose
business it was to get the name of every man in each house.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
The solicitor was usually a very old looking man. This
usually worked. If it did not, a messenger boy would show
up with a message saying that it must be delivered at once.
If this failed, there would come a letter from some prominent
institution, sent in an unsealed envelope, addressed to the
man offering him a job at an unusually high wage. One
or the other of these devices would usually establish touch
with the man wanted. It was like changing baits in a trap.</p>

<p>An interesting case was that of Harry <span class="nowrap">W——</span>, who was
brother of another Mr. <span class="nowrap">W——</span> sentenced to the workhouse
for violation of the Espionage Act. Harry did not register,
but was picked up in the City Council Chamber. He desperately
tried to convince the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. men that he was too
old, but the operatives got his birth record and proved that
he had wilfully evaded registration. Indicted and sentenced
to one year in the workhouse.</p>

<p>A deserter from Camp Sherman, in December, 1917, was
located wearing civilian clothes as late as September, 1918.
He was hidden by a certain woman, who had secreted his
uniform and who had supplied him with liquor repeatedly.
We learned that this was an illicit relation. The woman had
furnished the man with money from time to time. The
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. took her case up with the District Attorney. The
woman is awaiting indictment of a charge of furnishing
liquor to a soldier and harboring a deserter. Her lover is
back in camp.</p>

<p>The division had a good case on certain German sympathizers
believed to be sending certain information to the
enemy. A dictaphone was installed in a hotel room which
they occupied, and the place was watched day and night for
a week. Just at the time when it seemed that some information
was going to be reported, a parrot which the people had
in the room started to chatter and beat them into the dictaphone.
Nothing was discovered at that time and the Chief
reports, “I regret we cannot print what came over the dictaphone
by the parrot.”</p>

<p>Adolph <span class="nowrap">R——</span>, a German of the Germans, was within
the draft, but resisted in every possible way, and said he
would kill any members of the League who came after him.
He even called up individual members and told them he was
going to shoot them. When an order came he told the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
man that he would pay no attention. A detail was sent
after him and he was escorted like a little lamb to the barracks.
He has been a good German ever since.</p>

<p>The League found that it had in its ranks as an operative
a resident of the city of Cleveland, who had been there all
his life but was a German alien and not registered. This
fellow was arrested and interned for a short period, though
soon paroled.</p>

<p>The Cleveland division of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. took a very prominent
part in the Debs case, and furnished abundant men and
machines on the Sunday that Debs was arrested in Cleveland.
It also helped to assemble the evidence on which Debs was
indicted.</p>

<p>Washington was on the hunt for a dangerous enemy alien
by the name of Henry <span class="nowrap">H——</span>. Information came that
he was working for a photographic concern in Cleveland, but
he could not be located. Four months later a complaint of
pro-Germanism came in against a man of the same name
working for a city directory company. He had changed his
occupation but not his nature, and hence was arrested.</p>

<p>The printed page was another form of propaganda in
Cleveland. An alien enemy editor of a German paper was
allowed at large with restrictions. He abused his privilege
and was interned at Fort Oglethorpe. Indictments and convictions
were found against members of the staff of a German
daily. Yet another editor refused to print articles on food
conservation, and he also was indicted and convicted.
Sabotage was threatened and planned in many cases. In
one instance a tip got out that a big war plant was to be
blown up on one of two given nights. The League got on
the job and found the plant to be insufficiently guarded.
The guard was increased and no damage was done.</p>

<p>Gottlieb <span class="nowrap">K——</span>, an alien enemy, was caught out of his
zone without his permit. Operatives went to his home and
found two Mauser rifles, a peck of shells, a dagger, a blackjack
and several maps of Canada, the United States and
Mexico. Gottlieb was thought to be more fit for Fort Oglethorpe
than Cleveland.</p>

<p>Mr. A. L. <span class="nowrap">H——</span>, a member of the Cleveland Board of
Education, had his own idea about education. In the home
of a socialist he remarked that the Liberty Bonds would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
never be paid, and that the working class for generations
would have to work to support these bonds. He stated that
the Russian Committee, headed by Elihu Root, who went to
Russia to investigate the conditions there, had their report
written and signed before they left America. He frequently
said that the bonds of the United States were not worth the
paper they were written on. Affidavits resulted in the indictment
of Mr. <span class="nowrap">H——</span>, and he was sentenced to ten years in
the Atlanta Penitentiary, the conviction automatically removing
him from the Board of Education.</p>

<p>A mail carrier in Cleveland fell heir to $60,000, but being
a socialist, would not subscribe to Liberty Bonds. He was
called to the headquarters of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. and reasoned with.
The next day his son came into headquarters literally running
over with Liberty Bonds. He had $10,000 worth, all in
$100 denominations! They sent him home with a guard.</p>

<p>The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. was responsible for obtaining the evidence
that secured the conviction of the State Secretary of the
Socialist Party and two others. All of these men publicly
made speeches against the draft, and were actually instrumental
in preventing certain men from complying with the
Selective Service Act. All sentenced to one year of peace in
the Canton workhouse by the Federal Court.</p>

<p>A gentleman by the name of Joseph Freiheit—Freiheit
means “freedom” in German—said that if sent to the
army he would not shoot at the Germans. He advised his
friends to do the same. He was brought to headquarters and
reprimanded. The next day he committed suicide. Case
closed.</p>

<p>A man who owned a garage was reported hostile to Liberty
Bonds and Thrift Stamps. A certain operative went to talk
over with him the question of Thrift Stamps. The question
was asked, “How many do you want me to buy?” The
solicitor said he thought about a thousand dollars worth. He
bought a thousand dollars worth in cash, then and there.
Almost persuaded.</p>

<p>A very elusive draft dodger was Geo. <span class="nowrap">F——</span>, who was
chased from pillar to post, but not come up with. He was
discovered to have an intrigue with a waitress, Jennie
M——, who also would change her name once in a while,
leave her place of employment and be gone a day or two.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
The question was, where did she go? The operatives on the
case took Jennie down to the Federal Building, where she
told so many conflicting stories that she was locked up.
Meantime, the Post Office Department advised that certain
letters were sent back from Elyria, Ohio, addressed to “F.
J. <span class="nowrap">P——</span>.” The return card brought the trail around to
one of the original dwelling-places of the suspect. The
operative now went to this address and found the owner
of the home and threatened to arrest him for abetting a
deserter from the United States Army. These letters were
opened and it was discovered that the man desired was getting
mail at the post office at Monroe, Michigan. So the
operative went to Jennie in jail and said, “Well, we have
got George over in Michigan.” “Is that so?” said the girl;
“how did you get him?” The operative declined to tell,
and said the only thing he wondered about was what name
George was going under in Monroe. The girl finally admitted
that his name there was “F. J. <span class="nowrap">P——</span>.” It took
patience and shrewdness to follow the trail in Monroe. However,
a name was found written in two places in a register
of a workingmen’s hotel there. The initials were the same
as for F. J. <span class="nowrap">P——</span>, one of the many alias names. The
landlady was found, and a picture of Jennie was shown her.
She said it was the same picture that “F. J. <span class="nowrap">P——</span>” had
in the back of his watch. The rest was rather simple. The
operator hired a taxicab and started out in search of his man,
who then was engaged as night watchman on some road
work. A steam roller was found in the middle of the road,
displaying a red lantern, with a man fast asleep on top. The
operative awakened him, and identified him as the much
wanted Geo. <span class="nowrap">F——</span>, alias Ed. <span class="nowrap">D——</span>, alias Geo. <span class="nowrap">W——</span>,
alias F. J. <span class="nowrap">P——</span>, alias F. J. <span class="nowrap">P——</span>. The man was
handcuffed and the party started back for Monroe. In due
time, the suspect was taken to the Department of Justice,
and on December 14 the long trail ended for him. The
details of this pursuit are among the most interesting of those
which have been turned in for any case on the Cleveland
records.</p>

<p>One operative had what he took to be a regular Conan
Doyle novel, all spread out before him. It involved what
was known as “The House of Mystery,” where all kinds of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
mysterious goings and comings and every sort of dark, secret
midnight interview took place. After a long, long time the
house of mystery was closed. The inspector was able from
other information to tell the operatives what was the matter
with his case—which is not reported in full. The inspector
said: “Your elderly woman there is the mother of the
younger woman, who is married to a worthless scamp, from
whom she is seeking a divorce. They have a beautiful home
in the mountains of the West, and that is where they go
on the mysterious trips you have been noticing so long.
Their trunks are filled with valuable papers, and when they
finished discussing these, they put them back in the trunks.
The little child is the son of the young woman. The reason
they rented this isolated house and made a prisoner out of
the child was because the father has been trying to kidnap
the child. The mysterious chauffeur is the secretary of the
ladies. When he enlisted for the war they found cause to
weep on that account.” The operative had been working
on an ordinary society detective story instead of a plot
against the United States.</p>

<p>Perhaps these very few random cases may serve to show
the variety of the sixty thousand handled in Cleveland. What
did it all mean for the safety and security of the United
States? Who can measure it? That is a thing impossible.
But that the good citizens of Cleveland appreciated what
the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. has done may be seen from abundant local
evidence. Under date of December 24 the Cleveland newspapers
came out in open condemnation of the wave of crime
then threatening the city. The <i>Plain Dealer</i> said very
plainly:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The amazing boldness of bandits, burglars and miscellaneous
plug-uglies in Cleveland has finally stirred the city to an insistent
demand that something approaching war methods be
adopted in dealing with them. It is peculiarly irritating to
know that most, if not all, of the criminals are young men of
military age. While better men have been giving their lives
to free the world of the terror of Germanism, these stealthy
enemies have been staging a reign of terror of their own in a
modern American community. The American Protective
League has wisely placed its services at the disposal of the
police. All public spirited citizens should coöperate in every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
possible way. The police are shooting to kill, and the more
frequently their aim proves true the better it will be for
Cleveland. It is not time for leniency or compromise. The
thug of to-day, who has so serious a misapprehension of the
privilege of being an American, deserves nothing beyond a
snug grave. There have been other epidemics of outlawry in
Cleveland, and perhaps the present “crime wave” is no more
menacing than some that have gone before. But coming just
at this time, when so great a price has been paid to make
America and all the world safe and decent, the impudence of
the gunman is peculiarly infuriating.</p>
</div>

<p>The Cleveland <i>Press</i> headed one of its editorials: “Chief,
call out the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.!” In answer, the Chief of the Cleveland
Police did call on the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. once more, although this
was six weeks after hostilities had ceased. All of the following
Saturday night and Sunday there were A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. men
patrolling the streets of Cleveland in motor cars in company
with the police.</p>

<p>The disbanding of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. was openly deplored in
Cleveland. What is going to be the future condition of the
United States in these days following the war? One thing
is sure, the thinking men of the country are uneasy. There
is reason to feel concern, in a city like Cleveland, over bolshevism
and labor troubles. There do not lack those who
predict for all America the wave of disregard for property
and life which quite often ensues at the close of a great
war—and this war was the greatest upheaval of human
institutions and human values the world has ever seen. But
matters in Cleveland might have been worse—much worse.</p>

THE STORY OF CINCINNATI</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Data from a Supposed Citadel of Pro-Germanism—Gratifying
Reports from the City Which Boasts a Rhine of its
Own—Alien Enemies and How They Were Handled—Americanization
of America.</p>
</div>

<p>That Cincinnati had a vast population of German descent
and of pro-German sympathies was known throughout the
United States. It would be folly to say otherwise. Had
open riots or armed resistance to the draft, or to the war
itself, arisen in Cincinnati, there were many who would not
have been surprised. Those, however, did not really know
the inherently solid quality of the city on the Ohio River.
They may find that from the study of the able report of
the Cincinnati Division.</p>

<p>Perhaps a very considerable amount of the quiet on the
Rhine at Cincinnati was due to the fact that there was such
an organization within its gates as the American Protective
League. The members of the League were on the watch all
the time for anything dangerous in the way of pro-enemy
activity. That the division had a certain amount of work
to do may be seen from the summaries.</p>

<p>There were 2,972 investigations for disloyalty and sedition;
4,232 selective service investigations; 3,004 suspects
taken in slacker raids. Of propaganda by word of mouth,
there were 7,000 examinations. Three hundred and seventy
civilian applicants for overseas service were examined. There
were eighty-one examinations made into the character of
persons identified with the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W., the People’s Council,
and other pacifist or radical bodies. The Secret Service had
fifty examinations made for it and the Post Office three.
There were fourteen thousand visits made at homes and
places of business of alien enemies, and twenty-eight alien
enemies were required to report to the supervisor every week.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
Heatless Mondays required three hundred investigations and
gasless Sundays one thousand, five hundred and seventeen.
In 250 instances the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. rendered automobile service to
various Government departments. These figures show that
something was doing in Cincinnati. As to the exact nature of
the activities, it is much better to give the sober and just
estimate of the local chief, as gratifying as it is admirable:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From its inception the Cincinnati Division of the American
Protective League was vibrant with possibilities. Cincinnati
was known from coast to coast as a city settled by Germans.
It was presumed, of course, to be very largely pro-German
as a result of this reputation. “Over-the-Rhine” meant Cincinnati
to many who lived outside of its confines. The reputation
of the city was at stake. Those who knew Cincinnati,
however, felt that this reputation which came to us from
abroad was unjustified, and that although there was no gainsaying
that German blood flowed in the veins of a very large
number of its people, it was still ninety-nine per cent loyal;
and the record of the war has demonstrated the truth of this
statement.</p>

<p>Under the direction and supervision of Calvin S. Weakley,
Special Agent in charge of the Department of Justice, work
was carried on with quietness and despatch. He approached
every matter with an open mind, and it is to his excellent
judgment and his avoidance of brass-band methods that the
record of the Cincinnati office of the Bureau of Investigation
and its auxiliary, the Cincinnati Division of the American
Protective League, has been clean of criticism. In the
burglar-proof steel cabinets, however, repose documents and
reports which would create a sensation in the community,
and perhaps the day of reckoning is not far. While the fact
that many of these acts occurred before the United States
became an active participant in the world war may mean
legal immunity, yet the record is made, and in many cases
public opinion has been the sternest prosecutor of those individuals
(many of whom enjoy the rights of American citizenship),
whose sympathies as well as activities will always
brand them as having been unfit for the privileges which
they still continue to enjoy. It has brought to many of those
individuals social isolation—a punishment incomparable with
anything that can be meted out by judge or jury—and they
cannot help but feel the ignominy of their unpatriotic actions.
Loyalty to the country and a fine patriotism for the cause was
the keynote which seemed to animate the membership.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p>Hardly had the ink dried upon the President’s signature
to the document which made operative the original Selective
Service Act, when word filtered through to the office of the
Cincinnati Division American Protective League that there
was an undercurrent of opposition developing which would
culminate on Registration Day, June 5th, 1917. So-called
Socialists, who were in fact German propagandists, were the
most active in their criticism. Venomous advice was being
offered to young men, who, upon that historic day, would
enter their names upon the rolls of the prospective great
National Army.</p>

<p>The preliminary information which was gathered left no
doubt in the mind of Special Agent Weakley, at Cincinnati,
that unless an example was made of these so-called pacifists,
there was danger of an incomplete registration, and it became
very apparent from the preliminary investigations made that
the opposition to registration centered in a local unit of a
Socialist organization known as the Eleventh Ward.</p>

<p>Out of four operatives who entered into this particular case,
three were dropped, and one became a member of the inner
circle. The open meetings of the club divulged nothing, but
the secret sessions of the inner circle developed the plan
which would make as ineffective as possible registration in
Cincinnati and which undoubtedly would have succeeded.
Circulars and posters were secretly printed, and on the night
of June 1 they were to be distributed broadcast throughout
the northwestern section of Cincinnati. This literature not
only was seditious in character, but in the opinion of the
District Attorney, treasonable.</p>

<p>The League plan was so carefully and thoroughly developed
that not a guilty man escaped. There was quite a scene at
several police stations when operatives of the League, detailed
with local police detectives, brought in their men, each
with his pile of circulars. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. had direct evidence of
where these circulars had been placed—in letter boxes, on
door-steps, or handed to individuals on the street—and thus
made each case complete in itself; and when, the next day,
the newspapers told in detail the story of how this plan had
been nipped in the bud, anti-conscriptionists became enthusiastic
registrants. Even men who were arrested asked for
the privilege of registration. Cincinnati not only gave the
quota estimated for it, but a percentage so much higher as
to elicit surprise.</p>

<p>After the investigation had developed the real culprits, the
printing shop also was located, the form from which the
circulars had been printed confiscated, and the complete chain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
of evidence was sufficient to bring a unanimous report from
the Grand Jury, charging everyone involved with conspiracy
against the Government.</p>

<p>This was the first real big work successfully undertaken by
Cincinnati Division of the American Protective League. It
was carried out with thoroughness and dispatch, and nothing
was left undone that was necessary to make the cases complete.
It was wonderful training for the men who had come
from their business to the work of the League, and it developed
some of Cincinnati Division’s best operatives, who from
that time on approached every assignment with enthusiasm
and understanding.</p>

<p>Cincinnati Division supervised the parole of enemy aliens
from Fort Oglethorpe and the Federal jail in this district.
These paroled men, being released from prison, were ordered
to report at the office of Cincinnati Division once each week.
The day selected for them to report was Saturday morning.
Failure on the part of a paroled man to report on the date
set resulted in a prompt investigation. So thorough was this
supervision that Cincinnati Division could at any time put
its hands on these paroled men, whose ranks included actors,
draughtsmen, electrical engineers, art glass designers, chefs,
waiters, barbers, bakers, auto experts, laborers, machinists,
farmers, and merchants.</p>

<p>Only one man refused to mend his ways and live up to the
regulations. He is now at Fort Oglethorpe. When he first
was released, he tried to induce the Federal authorities to
give him permission to talk pro-German so he could “find
others who were against this country,” as he put it. He was
informed by the Special Agent in charge of the Cincinnati
office, Department of Justice, that he could do better work by
telling all his former associates how foolish they were, trying
to work for the Kaiser in this country. He had claimed that
his prison term had changed his opinion and that now he
was “for the United States.” He was instructed to tell this
to his friends as he would thereby be doing more good.
His term of freedom did not last long, for he was soon at his
old tricks again. He was interned for the “duration of the
war.”</p>

<p>After the German campaign against conscription in this
country had fallen flat, the active propagandists looked for
new fields for their malicious and insidious work. The
notorious German propaganda alliance known as “The
People’s Council,” newly formed in New York, was in its
infancy when word of its activities was brought to Cincinnati
by an advocate of the single tax, who up to that time had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
considered an extremist, but honest in intention. He became
associated with a certain Cincinnatian, American born of
German descent, an attorney of some reputation. These two
men contemplated organizing in Cincinnati a branch of The
People’s Council.</p>

<p>From the beginning, the League was represented at both the
private and secret meetings of the Council, which, for a time,
were held in the attorney’s office, where four or five gathered;
but as new recruits were enrolled by the Council and
larger quarters were required, they were transferred to an
office in Odd Fellow’s Temple occupied by a former minister,
a Socialist radical, a man whose career marked him as an
advocate of extreme measures, and who carried with him a
considerable following which he had organized several years
before. Pacifism was the big keynote of its original platform.
Without interference, however, the speakers became bold.
The intellectuals who enlisted under its banner included a
leading Sinn Feiner, a professor of a well-known college of
Cincinnati, who was chairman, a pastor of the Lutheran
Church, and, of course, the attorney and organizer.</p>

<p>It was the day of the original Espionage Act, and it was
difficult under this unamended Act to find violations; but
some of the speeches rang with treasonable utterances. After
months of this sort of thing, the Bureau of Investigation,
Department of Justice, decided it was time to act. A meeting
had been called for Friday night, at the office of the former
pastor, at which many things were expected to happen, and on
that night it was decided to make a search, not only of the
meeting place, but of the homes of the leaders. The District
Attorney asked every man present—League operatives, agents
of the Department of Justice, deputy United States Marshals,
and local police detectives who had been assigned to the work,
to set their watches with his. At 8:30 o’clock prompt, the
search, under due warrant of law, was made in all parts of
the city, and the papers and documents which were brought
to the office of the United States Attorney made it impossible
forever after for The People’s Council to carry on its nefarious
activities.</p>

<p>From that day Cincinnati was rid of openly organized anti-government
activities. Some of the papers found, proved of
great value to the Government. A special solicitor from the
office of the Attorney General at Washington was assigned
to Cincinnati to go over these papers, and the information
which he gathered was of great use in many other cities.
As a result of this search, the professor who had taken such
an important part in the work of The People’s Council was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
censured by his Board, and eliminated from the local theatre
of activities.</p>

<p>The case of The People’s Council was one of the high spots
in the work of Cincinnati Division, American Protective
League, and the record in this case is one of which it can
well be proud. Later, the former pastor, much to the regret
of Cincinnati Division, was taken in hand by citizens of Kentucky
for special treatment. His experience on that dark
night in the foot-hills of Kentucky evidently broke his spirit
enough to dishearten him. He is no longer a factor in
Bolshevism in Cincinnati.</p>

<p>After the reorganization of Cincinnati Division had been
effected, to conform to the new plan of the National Directors,
Chief Gerson J. Brown decided that it would be good policy
to keep in close touch with the fifteen hundred male enemy
aliens in Hamilton County. Accordingly, after fully considering
the matter, he organized the Enemy Alien Bureau. The
operatives were instructed as to all regulations governing
these aliens, so that they could give advice whenever called
upon by their charges, who did not know just what the
Government expected of them. All delinquents were taken
to the office of the Marshal by American Protective League
members and made to complete their registration. Following
out their instructions, American Protective League members
fully explained to the aliens the object of their visit and just
what their privileges were under the regulations. In a majority
of the cases, it was found that the alien really had never
fully understood what the Government regulations were.</p>

<p>Many peculiar situations were found. In several cases it
developed that aliens, who had passes issued by the Marshal
permitting them to go to their places of employment and
return by the most direct route, lived above the store in which
they worked. Arrangements were made with the Marshal
whereby these men, when found worthy, were given permits
entitling them to enjoy more privileges. Others were found
who went direct to their work, and on returning in the
evening, feared to go out of the house. Others would not
go to church, fearful that they would be arrested and interned.</p>

<p>There were also cases of men who were in business which
made it necessary to go into zones not mentioned in their
permits. Many other odd cases, too numerous to mention,
were found. All were taken up separately with the Marshal,
and where the League records showed that the alien was trying
to obey the regulations, necessary permits were issued.</p>

<p>There were found by American Protective League operatives
aliens who wanted to become citizens but who did not know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
what to do. Others had tried to pass examinations in court,
but failed. All these were sent to citizenship schools and
now are on the road to becoming desirable citizens. The work
of the Bureau has been such that many aliens now have a
different opinion of what it means to live in a country where
all men who behave themselves have an equal chance. In
one day, after citizenship schools were opened in Cincinnati,
the Enemy Alien Bureau issued over two hundred permits to
aliens who desired to gain knowledge which would permit
them to apply for the necessary papers.</p>

<p>This close supervision also forestalled attempts by agents
of the Kaiser to induce aliens to commit acts against this
Government, if they were so inclined. No meetings could be
held without an American Protective League member hearing
of it, as they visited the alien at his home and place of
employment at irregular intervals, and never less than once
a month.</p>

<p>After the war, there will be many, now classed as enemy
aliens, who will thank Cincinnati Division for having helped
them at a critical time when they were floundering about
under regulations which they did not understand, and feared
to ask anyone how to become loyal citizens of this country.
Of the many curious cases Cincinnati handled, we may report
at least one, which shows how well the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. sometimes
took care of a man who didn’t deserve it.</p>

<p>An emergency telephone call came to the office of the
American Protective League from an official of one of the
largest trust companies in the city, to send an operative to
the bank as quickly as possible. The two men who answered
the call found they had what appeared to be a German agent
in prospect.</p>

<p>During the afternoon a telegram came to the bank from the
Empire Trust Company, New York, authorizing it to place
$25,000 to the credit of Frank <span class="nowrap">K——</span>. <span class="nowrap">K——</span>, on his
arrival at the bank, seemed to be a man about fifty-five years
of age, typically German, with all the Hindenburg ear-marks.
An over-anxiety to display his naturalization papers in proving
his identity led the bank officials to put him off until they had
been able to communicate with the League. He had given his
room number at the Gibson Hotel, and with this information
in hand and a code message to the New York Division to
investigate at that end, the scene shifted to the hotel.</p>

<p>His room was searched but absolutely nothing was found
that could possibly throw light on the use he intended to make
of the money, or the purpose of his visit to Cincinnati. He
was “covered” that night by operatives of the League, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
on the following day was taken to the office of the Special
Agent in charge, and there questioned for two hours, without
his disclosing anything of importance. <span class="nowrap">K——</span> finally told
his story, and from this point on the plot quickly unravels.</p>

<p>He was born near Hanover, Germany, emigrated to America
at the age of sixteen, settled in New York, married, and was
naturalized at the age of twenty-two. Three children blessed
his union. He was a stone-mason by trade for ten years
after his marriage; then he entered the contracting line and
continued in it for some eighteen years, later removing to
East Orange, N. J., where for some five years he operated a
saloon and road house, later retiring from business and removing
to West Hoboken, N. J.</p>

<p>After a severe siege of rheumatism, he was ordered by his
physician to Mount Clemens, Michigan, early in the spring
of 1918. At that resort he came in contact with two very
affable gentlemen, “Fred B. Grant” and “Jack Connel.” They
made a lavish display of wealth and finally were successful in
getting him to ask where these large amounts came from,
whereupon Grant, who was the spokesman of the two, told
K—— he was a wealthy coal operator of West Virginia and
that he had a special system of playing the races. After
taking <span class="nowrap">K——</span> behind one of the buildings at Mount Clemens,
he swore him to secrecy, and “let him in” on his get-rich-quick
plan.</p>

<p>The party left Mount Clemens and went to the Vendome
Hotel, Newport, Ky. They took <span class="nowrap">K——</span> to a supposed pool-room
and in less than a week he had won upwards of twenty-five
thousand dollars in bets, whereupon the proprietor of the
pool-room told him that he could not withdraw this money,
under the laws of the State of Kentucky, unless he had an
equal amount on deposit in the State. <span class="nowrap">K——</span> told his
daughter in Hoboken that he must have twenty-five thousand
dollars to complete a business deal. He put up some of the
money himself, and she secured the rest by a loan from the
Empire Trust Co. Again the shuttle moved back to Cincinnati,
where he arrived on Monday, August 5, 1918, and
the League came to his rescue. <span class="nowrap">K——</span> was now convinced
that he was marked for a victim, and he did all he could to
help land his supposed friends. All these were taken and the
prisoners were held in $15,000 bond. They were notorious
confidence men!</p>

<p>The pool-room was found with its complete telephone and
telegraph outfit, which was not connected with any outside
line. The money which Kaiser saw in this pool-room was
paper cut from a New York Telephone directory to the size<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
of a dollar bill. This paper was placed in stacks of probably
four or five inches thick, with a hundred dollar bill placed
on top and a hundred dollar bill on the bottom. The
“money” lay around in great profusion. <span class="nowrap">K——</span> stated with
bulging eyes that he saw “at least a million dollars in this
room.” At least, the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. saved him $25,000 by taking him
for a Cincinnati German spy!</p>

THE STORY OF DAYTON</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Aircraft-Center Well Cared For—Midnight and All’s
Well—Some Stories of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. and the Melting Pot—Possible
and Impossible Citizens.</p>
</div>

<p>The thriving city of Dayton, Ohio, is one of the best
known towns of the size in the Union. In some way the
idea has gone abroad that Dayton is up-to-date, modern and
advanced alike in industrial, civic and social ways. There
surely is no reason to alter that belief from the story of the
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. turned in from Dayton. An additional interest
attaches to the report from this industrial capital because
of the fact that it has always been a sort of a capital of industrial
enterprise, and has been known as one of the points
of manufacture of Government aeroplane material.</p>

<p>The large foreign element gave rise to 661 disloyalty cases
and made necessary 269 instances of persuasiveness in Liberty
Bond matters. For the War Department there were
handled 1,681 slacker cases and 1,078 other cases under the
Selective Service Act, with 387 cases of deserters and 241
character and loyalty examinations. The total number of
investigations was 6,118. Many of the local “case stories”
show that Ohio still has her claim to be called a center of
pro-German sentiment, but the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. did fine work in
the reclamation of such citizen material as was worth reclaiming—some
of it was not worth while. The American
Protective League has been the best and almost the first real
Immigration Board this country ever knew, and the one
great need of America to-day is a wise and wholly fearless
combing out of the aliens.</p>

<p>Mr. George S. Blanchard was first Chief of the Dayton
Division. In the early days of April, 1917, he was talking
with a friend from St. Louis and during the conversation
asked him what he was doing toward the progress of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
big war. His friend replied that he had gone into the American
Protective League, which had just been organized in
St. Louis. The remark set him to thinking that probably
an organization of this kind could be effected in Dayton. The
League at that time was in a very primitive state. That is
to say, the desire to assist the Department of Justice was
there, but neither the League nor the Department of Justice
had yet been able to work out the best method by which inexperienced
citizens could assist in Federal investigations. Mr.
Blanchard visited the divisions of the League at Columbus,
Ohio, Chicago, San Francisco, New York City and other
places, and called a number of times for conferences at National
Headquarters. The mode of conducting operations as
determined by experience and observation of the work carried
out by other divisions and as directed by National Headquarters
was as follows: Alien Enemy; Pro-German; Draft
Board Matters; Vice and Liquor; Military Coöperation;
Food and Fuel; Suburban; War Risk Allotments; Headquarters;
Flying Squadron; Character Investigations.</p>

<p>The general direction of the work was made by the Chief.
The work was then carried out by ten different divisions,
each governed by a Captain with as many Lieutenants and
operatives as his work demanded. Later came the general
division of all workers into two classes—Investigation and
Information. The captains, lieutenants and active members
were taken from the investigators. In October, 1918, Mr.
Blanchard resigned as Chief of the Dayton Division to enlist
in the Motor Transport Corps of the United States Army,
being succeeded by Mr. Frank Schwilk, who carried on the
work very successfully.</p>

<p>During a war drive, an operative, No. 161, called on a Mr.
B——, who had refused absolutely to give a cent, although
financially able to contribute. Operative reports: I questioned
him as to why he would not give, and he replied:</p>

<p>“Why should I give? I don’t live here anyhow. My
body belongs to God and He told me not to give.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” replied the operative, “but you have
citizenship here, have you not?”</p>

<p>“No. I vote in Heaven. You can take me and place me
in jail, but Christ will take care of me.”</p>

<p>“If the Germans came down the street and were about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
to strike down your children and take away your wife, what
would you do,—sit down and allow it?”</p>

<p>“I could not raise a hand against them because God tells
me not to strike my enemies, so the Germans could do as they
saw fit.”</p>

<p>“Religious crank—what’s the use?” asks the operative.</p>

<p>An old man and his wife, both German, were reported to
the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. one day last summer as being pro-German and
Lieutenant No. 177 was assigned to the case. He called on
the old couple and found them very German indeed—so
much so, in fact, that their niece was produced to act as
interpreter. The old man, when he realized the object of
the visit, became greatly agitated, and trembling like an
aspen leaf, he hurriedly produced his naturalization papers
and protested that three times had he foresworn the Kaiser.
At last, as final proof of loyalty to his adopted land, the
old man displayed some sheets of manuscript—gospel songs,
which he himself had written in his mother tongue! At this
point his wife, who had been as distressed as her husband
over the interview, could restrain herself no longer.</p>

<p>“Ach no!” she spluttered. “No! Ve are not Chermans.
Ve are not Chermans! Ve are Christians! Ve are Christians!”</p>

<p>Operative No. 113 reports the details of a case which
has in it endless possibilities of mischief:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There was held in Dayton, Ohio, during the summer of
1918, the national meeting of Automotive Engineers, and at the
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. luncheon that day it was reported that a German from
a nearby city, who was an associate member of the Automotive
Engineers, was registered in Dayton and would attend the
meetings of the convention. From the history we had of
this gentleman from the files of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L., he was undoubtedly
a dangerous citizen and one who should not have the
opportunity of inspecting and carefully examining the Liberty
Motors and many other new ideas which were being shown
at the convention. I offered to investigate the situation, took
the information which was in our hands, got in touch with
the head of the Aircraft Production Board here and was
immediately sent to the convention, where I conferred with
the Secretary, explaining to him in detail the facts. We
found that our man was not registered at the convention,
and we made arrangements with the registrar that as soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
as he made his appearance, some one should shadow him
and see that he did not have access to any information or
special displays, and that he should be kept under surveillance
during his entire time in our city. I knew where he
was stopping and kept him under surveillance. We frustrated
any plan he might have had to gain confidential information.
All this was done without his having any idea that
anyone knew his history or his reason for coming to the
convention.</p>
</div>

<p>One of the most interesting cases investigated was that of
two families, Mr. A. and Mr. B., who lived on the same
street. Mr. A. died, leaving one son of draft age, the main
support of his mother. He filed no exemption claim, was
inducted into the United States Army, and is now serving
in France. In the family of Mr. B., father and mother were
both living, both born in Germany. They had a son of
draft age, who was inducted into the United States Army
and sent to Camp Sherman, where he stayed for three
months and was then discharged because of flat feet. He
came home and went to work at his trade as a plumber. Mr.
B., Sr., owned the house wherein the widow of A. lived, and
immediately upon the return of B., Jr., proceeded to raise
the widow’s rent and put her out of the house. The Red
Cross had been paying the widow’s rent, but finally legal
notice was served allowing her ten days in which to vacate
the house.</p>

<p>An A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operative took the matter up with a local
attorney and arranged for the protection of the widow in
case force should be used to eject her; he then called on Mr.
B., Sr., again and began praising him regarding his success
in life, his unusual ability, and so on. He finally asked
him this question:</p>

<p>“Mr. B., if you were in America and your mother in
Germany, and some one were annoying and abusing her and
trying to force her out in the street, what would you do?”</p>

<p>“I would fight,” he said.</p>

<p>Then the operative reversed the question and cited the
other young man who was fighting for his country, and some
one trying to put his mother out into the street. Mr. B.
silently looked down at his feet and then said:</p>

<p>“You have proven to me my great mistake. I have done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
wrong and am going to make everything right.” He dismissed
his case in court, apologized to the widow, and from
all recent observation, is trying to be a truly American
citizen.</p>

<p>Another operative reports:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>During the spring of 1918 there were rumors in the city
of Dayton that Mr. <span class="nowrap">B——</span>, a hardware merchant, American
born but of German parentage, was very pro-German in his
talk and attitude, and as I had known the man for some
years, I made it a point to get his viewpoint as to the war
and his opinion regarding the United States entering the war.
Mr. <span class="nowrap">B——</span> was very guarded in everything he said, but
would always intimate just enough to arouse the anger of a
good American citizen, and while he would not make any
statements that could be considered as absolutely unpatriotic
or dangerous, yet it was evident that at heart he was pro-German
and was quietly spreading propaganda in favor of
Germany. I talked to him until I found that I was getting a
little too warm around the collar and would have to move on.
One morning I was quite interested when <span class="nowrap">B——</span> advised
me that he was going to enter a certain Officers’ Training
Camp and would leave on a certain fixed date, two weeks later.
I pumped him as well as I could to get all the facts, which
within an hour’s time I communicated to headquarters. The
information was communicated to headquarters of the Officers’
Training Camp and <span class="nowrap">B——</span> was advised by the proper officer
that he need not report. What reason they gave him I did
not know!</p>

<p>I called on <span class="nowrap">B——</span> about a week later and expressed to
him my surprise that he was still here and asked why he had
not gone to camp. He replied that he was too busy to get
away and would wait until a later period. This excuse, of
course, was all right with me, but he did not know that
some one had been on his trail and kept him from becoming
well acquainted with the inside workings of training camp
activities, and removed the possibility of his slipping across
his German propaganda.</p>
</div>

<p>Dayton sends in another story, worth pondering and remembering
by every American. This book is written for
Americans. The story will show what other races we sometimes
harbor. The man’s name is given.</p>

<p>Captains No. 145 and No. 245 were given an assignment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
entitled “Frank Weiss, alien enemy; Refusal to Register.”
The story, as told by them, is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Having been informed that Weiss was a dangerous character,
we proceeded to his place of employment and asked for
an interview, which was granted by the superintendent of
the concern. We found Weiss busily engaged at his work,
told him our business and were informed that we could “go to”
so far as he was concerned, that he had not registered and
did not intend to do so, although he had been given seven
days in which to make up his mind or go to jail. We did
not argue the question with him but immediately took him
before the Special Agent in charge of the Department of
Justice, Harold L. Scott. Mr. Scott asked him what his
objection was to registering with his Local Board, as the law
required, to which Weiss answered:</p>

<p>“I have registered with the police and that is sufficient.
I’m not a citizen of this country. I’m a subject of the Kaiser,
and there’s one thing sure—after this war is over, I’m sure
going to leave this country. I’ve thought it all over and
that’s what I’m going to do.”</p>

<p>U. S. Marshal Devanney happened to be present and explained
to Weiss that the best thing for him to do was to
register, telling him that he did not blame him for maintaining
his allegiance to his own country; that he admired a man
always for doing what he thought was right, but that he must
conform to the laws of this country governing alien enemies.</p>

<p>All through the interview, Weiss’s attitude was one of
defiance, but he thought the matter over for a few minutes
and then stated that he was willing to register with the Local
Board. He was escorted to the Board by No. 145 and the
Chairman asked:</p>

<p>“Mr. Weiss, where do you work and what salary do you
earn?”</p>

<p>“I work at <span class="nowrap">B——</span> Machine Company and get eighty-five
cents an hour; with overtime I make $100.00 per week.”</p>

<p>“Making such a salary as that, Mr. Weiss, don’t you think
you owe this country something? You could not possibly
earn that much money in one week in Germany, could you?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Weiss, “but I’m a skilled mechanic and that’s
what they pay in this country, and I’m entitled to it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the Chairman, “but in view of the fact that
this country affords you such good wages and allows you to
send your children to the public schools, don’t you think it
your duty to at least comply with all the laws governing
alien enemies such as you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>

<p>To this Weiss made no reply, but by constant questioning
the questionnaire was finally filled out and Weiss was asked
to “swear” to it, to which he replied:</p>

<p>“I will take no oath. I do not believe in a God, and refuse
to recognize him in any way whatsoever.”</p>

<p>His convictions in this matter were respected. He was
allowed to affirm, and was then taken to the Miami County
jail. After his incarceration it developed that two of Weiss’s
children were living with a Mrs. Smith in Dayton, Ohio—two
bright little girls—and that there would have to be some
provision made for them, as Mrs. Smith was simply boarding
the children and was unable to keep them unless their board
was paid. Mrs. Smith wrote a letter to Weiss setting forth
the facts, to which he replied that she should “take the children
to the office of the United States Marshal and leave them
there.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith brought the children to the office of the United
States Marshal, who made arrangements with the Juvenile
Court to place the children in the Orphans’ Home, where
they were to be cared for until Weiss was released. Weiss
was arrested on October 24, 1918, and on account of good
behavior, was granted a parole on November 14 and was
released from the Miami County jail on December 5, 1918.
Immediately upon being granted his freedom, after having
complied with all the rules and regulations governing his
parole, he went to the Juvenile Court and obtained release
papers for his two children, who were confined in the Orphans’
Home, the Judge of the Juvenile Court having been notified
that Weiss’s behavior since his incarceration had been first-class
and it was thought that he really had a change of heart.
But it was the same old story of “Kamerad! Kamerad!” As
soon as Weiss had obtained the release papers for his two
children he presented himself at the institution where they
were being cared for and demanded them immediately.</p>

<p>“They are in school now,” replied Mrs. Hartrum, Matron
of the Home, “but will be dismissed in about twenty minutes.
Won’t you be seated and wait for them?”</p>

<p>“No,” he replied, “I’m tired of this damned dirty red tape.
I want them right now.”</p>

<p>Pauline, the office girl, hearing Weiss’s remark and fearing
trouble for the teacher, ran to the school and related what
she had heard, so that in case Weiss came to the school to
demand the children, the teacher would be prepared for him.
Pauline was right, as Weiss refused to wait for the coming
of his children and left Mrs. Hartrum, going to the school
and demanding that the children be turned over to him immediately.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
He was told that school was just being dismissed
and that he should wait at the door for the children and
could get them as they came out. When he at last obtained
possession of the children he took them toward the Home
and was met at the gate by Pauline, who told him that Mrs.
Hartrum had requested that he bring the children in that she
might change their clothes, as they were wearing the uniform
of the Home. Weiss struck at Pauline, saying: “I’ll knock
you down and slap your face if you don’t keep still.”</p>

<p>Pauline rushed into the house to tell Mrs. Hartrum and
Weiss followed closely behind her.</p>

<p>“I want my children and I want them now,” said Weiss.</p>

<p>“You can have them as soon as I take them to their room
and change their clothes,” replied Mrs. Hartrum.</p>

<p>“You will not take them from this room. I’m G— <span class="nowrap">d——</span>d
tired of this red tape business, I’m not going to wait, and
don’t you dare to take these children from this office.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hartrum replied that she would take them to their
room and change their clothes and then bring them back.
Whereupon Weiss pushed Mrs. Hartrum backwards and she
fell into a chair, her head striking a table nearby, and he
then struck her as she lay on the floor, took his children and
hurried down the street to a Fifth Street car.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hartrum screamed. Her cries were heard by an attendant
in the yard, who came to her assistance, but Weiss
had fled. The attendant got into an automobile and followed
the street car, and when Weiss alighted uptown with his
children, he was arrested by the traffic policeman, the story
of Weiss having been previously related to him by the attendant.</p>

<p>Weiss was taken to police headquarters, the proper authorities
were notified, and after a thorough investigation his
parole was annulled and he was again committed to the
Federal jail. Investigation showed that Weiss was really an
anarchist at heart, and on the same day the assault was committed
upon Mrs. Hartrum, the following advertisement appeared
in the Dayton Journal:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>WANTED—Dayton men and women out of
work to send names and addresses to
FRANK WEISS, Post Office, Box 387, to
form a union to get Justice to make the
American workman’s home a decent place
to live in.</p>
</div>

<p>A few days later the good word came to us that Weiss had
been interned at Fort Oglethorpe until after the war, and
will be deported at that time.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>If a few hundred thousand more went with Herr Weiss,
this country would be yet better off. His attitude is not unusual—America
is simply a place for making easy money,
but Germany is the real place for a man! How should we
feel about letting in a few hundred thousands of the recently
demobilized German army? It is reported in the European
despatches that many of them are planning to come to America
as soon as possible. The ablest publicists of the day agree
that American immigration must be sharply restricted. Some
extremists believe that practically all immigration should
be stopped for a term of ten years.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>
THE STORY OF DETROIT</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>History of the Great Munition City—Clock-Like Mechanism
of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.—How the War Plants were Protected—Guarding
the Neck of the Great Lakes Bottle.</p>
</div>

<p>It often has been said that the shipping of the Great
Lakes, all of which passes through the Detroit River, is
greater in annual tonnage than that which goes through the
Suez Canal or the Panama Canal. A continual procession
of ore ships and carriers of other freight passes by the water
front of Detroit, going and coming on the clear, blue, rapid
flood of the river which may be called the “neck of the
bottle” of the Great Lakes.</p>

<p>Obviously, such a situation, collecting the riches of an
empire, is one offering its own purely geographical menace.
An unwatched enemy could sit on Detroit River front and
destroy untold billions in property in the course of a month.
But no such enemy did any such thing in this war.</p>

<p>Speaking of Detroit itself, without reference to its geographical
situation, it is to be said that it had as many munition
contracts as any city in the United States—Detroit
contracts for war material and munitions ran over $400,000,000.
These great war plants attracted the attention of
men hostile to this country. No one can tell how much harm
was wished against such enterprises by aliens who only
awaited their opportunity. The point is that this twenty
miles of water front of Detroit, these miles of railroad tracks
for switching facilities, these many great buildings where
manufacturing went on, were kept free from any destructive
enemy activity. That is a great story of itself, and far
greater than it would have been had it to record some great
disaster—interesting and thrilling, but none the less a disaster.
Detroit had no disasters. Instead, it had the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.</p>

<p>Detroit division began operations in the Spring of 1917,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
and at first was financed by the payment of a one dollar
initiation fee by each member. This continued until December,
1917, when it was seen that this division could not
go on unless better financed. A meeting of officers of prominent
manufacturers of Detroit was held, and these assured
the division better quarters and competent finances. A
committee went to Washington to see the Attorney General,
with the result that the offices of the Department of Justice
and those of the League were established close together.</p>

<p>Mr. Fred M. Randall, the first Chief, resigned in May,
1918, and was replaced by Mr. Frank H. Croul, former
Commissioner of Police, who took the oath of Chief not
only for Detroit but also for the County of Wayne. He
started in by reorganizing the work.</p>

<p>Since the Detroit contracts for war material were so
enormous—Detroit claims they were greater in volume than
for any other city in the country—a division was organized
under the name “Plants Protection Department.” A
thorough covering of each plant was made and a captain of
the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. was stationed in each factory, where he had
entire supervision and reported direct to the Plants Protection
Department at the League’s main office. That this
system worked well may be shown by the records. Detroit
was practically free of any destruction of war material.
Several attempts to blow up plants were frustrated. It was
not unusual for a man to be brought in from the plants for
an interview, and many such cases were turned over to the
Department of Justice and District Attorney’s office. The
dynamiter and other alien enemies were held down hitless.</p>

<p>A Pro-German Department was organized with captains,
lieutenants and operatives under charge of an Inspector.
The Inspector assigned all complaints, took all reports and
returned them to the Record Department where the original
papers were attached, and then forwarded them to the Pro-German
Committee room where they were examined and
passed upon.</p>

<p>A third department was called the Selective Service, its
work being to attend to the local boards of Detroit, of which
there were twenty-seven, exclusive of those in the district
and Wayne County. A unique manner of handling delinquents
was inaugurated—and why all states did not adopt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
the same system is a mystery. This bureau was kept open
to receive delinquents twenty-four hours a day and handled
thousands of draft cases.</p>

<p>Department No. 4 handled all personal cases, such as applicants
for war service or for commissions. Department No.
5 had the soldiers’ allotment cases. The last of the departments
was the Emergency. This department held a group
of experienced and reliable operatives who held themselves
in readiness to obey any call, whether during business hours
or in the cold, gray dawn. Four shifts were worked by
squads, six hours each, so that no matter what time a telephone
rang there was someone on the desk. Emergency Department
was of great service to the local draft boards, from
whose shoulders A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. took all the responsibility. It very
often apprehended men who were ready to make a quick getaway.</p>

<p>In connection with Plants Protection work, there was a
system whereby the plant sent to the main office each day
a personnel card saying that such and such a man had
applied for employment, that he had registered in such and
such a town and that his classification was as shown on the
card. Then the central office would write to the man’s local
board asking about him. If he was wanted, a complaint
was made out against him and the Emergency squad was
ordered to locate him and take him at once to the Bureau of
Delinquents. The number of daily notices sent in by different
boards all through the United States several times
ran into three figures.</p>

<p>Often the Department of Justice would want emergency
help to cover a suspect who was on his way to Detroit under
charge of some D.&nbsp;J. agent. Detroit operatives would meet
the train and keep surveillance until the party left the city.
In the matter of raids on dance halls and theatres for evaders
and slackers, the Emergency Division also gave great assistance
to the police. It often took to the central headquarters
hundreds of men who could not show proper credentials.</p>

<p>A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. Detroit Division took under charge also the tremendous
tonnage of the Detroit River. Operators boarded
every boat going up or down the river, and each man on
that boat was examined as to his credentials and citizenship.
A man might be allowed to go on his trip under guarantee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
of the captain, but in the meantime if there was any doubt
the wires were kept hot further along the Lakes to see if the
man was wanted. Several were apprehended in this way at
ports of call on information furnished by Detroit.</p>

<p>Another A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. custom was to investigate each actor’s
card as he appeared at any theatre, and if there was any
doubt, wire his board giving his description and asking for
his status. Several alien actors were landed in that way—who
were bad actors. They could not get away because they
were booked. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. never waited, but always was on
hand at the first performance of a company. These investigations
furnished several theatrical men for Uncle Sam’s
Army.</p>

<p>The division worked to protect the Government and to
protect the people also. There were a number of cases where
a man and wife were reconciled; where a man and woman
had been living together without marriage and where a marriage
was performed; where a soldier’s dependents were in
destitute circumstances and did not get the allotment. Domestic
tragedies such as these ran into hundreds, and quite often
the division was able to straighten them out. Many a man
was considered a slacker who had tried every means of getting
into the Army. Many a man looked healthy, though
the Army regulations disqualified him. Such men were, as a
rule, sensitive as to their physical condition. The division
made things clearer and made them easier in many cases.</p>

<p>There were many ways in which the division proved itself
useful on a common-sense and practical business basis. For
instance, a soldier, gone to France, left his home in charge
of a friend who had agreed to rent it, keep up the improvements,
and so on. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. found that the friend had collected
the rent for months, but did not keep up the improvements
and did not pay the taxes. It was found he had collected
several hundred dollars and had not paid out anything.
He happened to own a house of his own, so he mortgaged
that and paid over the money he had collected. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
arranged with one of the banks to act as trustee for the
soldier. The taxes were paid and the rents are now being
placed to the credit of the soldier. If it had not been for
the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L., the soldier would have found his property badly
depreciated on his return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span></p>

<p>This gives the barest, and, indeed, a most vague idea of
the many and well-organized activities of this division. As
a machine of protection it was deadly efficient. No place in
the country had more to lose than had Detroit. It was a
vulnerable point. It was the armor and weapons, offensive
and defensive, of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. which guarded it. The
manufacturers of Detroit furnished cash for the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
The individual citizens of Detroit did not pay a cent, nor
did the United States Government. Recognizing this unselfish
work of thousands of its citizens, the Detroit Patriotic
Fund Committee in July, 1918, made an unsolicited grant
of sufficient funds to keep the division going for another
year.</p>

<p>Detroit Division had a total of 30,056 complaints entered
on the files. Of members there were enrolled in all 3,903.
To each of these in good standing there was given an engraved
testimonial, his sole pay for months of time given
free to his country:</p>

<p>Detroit Division assisted the Bureau of Delinquents and
the Police Department in several raids for slackers at which
about 5,000 or 6,000 men were examined for registration
cards. Those who had registered and qualified are not included
above. They would number about 5,000 more. The
division also gave material assistance to the police and fire
departments, especially during the armistice days, when from
four hundred to five hundred operatives were on special
duty.</p>

<p>It would be rather bootless to delve deep into the individual
records of a city where the totals are so large, but
a few of the Detroit cases might be given in passing. One
of these had to do with an alleged attempt of a draft board
official to obtain money from a registrant for keeping him
out of the service. That complaint came in at noon. By
four o’clock of the same afternoon Lieutenant No. 610 had
the facts. That was Saturday, and Monday was Armistice
Day. Tuesday morning the matter came up before a judge
of the Federal Court. A thirteen months’ sentence at Leavenworth
penitentiary was imposed the third day after the
complaint came in.</p>

<p>This accusation was that a clerk, S. <span class="nowrap">W——</span> (the name is
unpronounceable) of Board No. 6 had told a registrant,
G——, apparently of the same nationality as himself,
that for a certain sum he would keep him out of the draft.
He was to appear between noon and one o’clock on November
9 and make the payment. Operative says he told <span class="nowrap">G——</span>’s
employers to pay him the nine dollars due him, and he took
the numbers of the bills. “I told <span class="nowrap">G——</span> to come with me
to Local Board No. 6,” he says, “and see this clerk whose
name I did not know, and if he took the money to report to
me on the first floor of the building. In the meantime I
informed one of the members of our Delinquent Board of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
my intentions, with a view to forestalling any later accusation
that the money had been ‘planted’ by the clerk. In a
little while <span class="nowrap">G——</span> appeared and said he had paid the
money to the clerk, who demanded that he bring in some
more money the following Monday, as that was not enough.
I then went to Local Board No. 6 with <span class="nowrap">G——</span>, who pointed
out this clerk as the one who had taken the money. I took
this clerk into a side room, accompanied by the others. He
acknowledged he had the money and that it had been given
him by <span class="nowrap">G——</span>. I told him to turn it over to a member of
the Board of Delinquents, and we verified the bills with
the description and numbers on the list already made out.
I then took the suspect to the Special Agent’s office, where
we obtained a signed confession from him. He was taken
before the District Attorney and held for the grand jury.
The grand jury met November 11 at 2:00 P. M. and returned
an indictment. On Tuesday morning he was arraigned before
the judge, pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to Leavenworth
penitentiary.”</p>

<p>Detroit had an interesting alien enemy case in that of
Fred <span class="nowrap">G——</span>, escaped petty officer of the Germany Navy
who had been working in Detroit for six months under the
name of Walter <span class="nowrap">B——</span>. He was an attendant in a sanitarium
and somehow seemed a little worth suspicion, although
nothing he said could be looked on as much out of the way.
The man who reported the case was used as a stool pigeon.
At length they met in a hotel under the pretense of an invention
which would be useful to any one of the nations in the
war. A dictaphone was put in the room where they were to
meet, and four A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operatives were in the next room at
the other end of the instrument. There were three such
meetings, and finally sufficient evidence was secured to warrant
D.&nbsp;J. in arresting the man. The final play was made
the next Saturday night, when he was arrested at the hotel
and locked up until Monday. This man had first papers
issued to him under the name of Walter <span class="nowrap">B——</span>, as a Hollander,
and when brought before D.&nbsp;J. on Monday, he maintained
that he was a Hollander and had left home at an
early age owing to brutal treatment from his father. After
one and a half hours’ work he finally broke down and gave
up his story. He admitted that his real name was Fred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
G——, that he was in the German Navy and had been on
the commerce raider <i>Emden</i> when that ship was driven with
several others into Guam by the Japanese fleet. He was
taken sick and transferred to Mare Island, California, after
internment. After his recovery in California he escaped,
he said, by swimming the channel to the mainland. He began
to beat his way on freight trains to various parts of the
country. He was employed in New York for a time as
messenger in a bank. Then he drifted to Detroit, worked
at various occupations in automobile factories, etc., and was
a motorman on the street cars. This man finally opened up
and gave the Department of Justice a line of information
which, had the war continued longer, would have proved of
the greatest importance. He was ordered interned by the
United States Government. In this case the division was
able to see the actual results of its work. There have been
many other cases which might have turned out as well in the
dénouement, but this one seemed to begin with nothing and
ended with good and visible results.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>
THE STORY OF ST. LOUIS</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>How the Pro-German Was Kept Mild—Sober and Well-Considered
Methods—A Big Secret Code Puzzle—Business
As Usual.</p>
</div>

<p>The summaries for St. Louis tell the same story of patient
and indefatigable loyalty, resolved to hold America strictly
American. The St. Louis story is modest, straightforward
and convincing. It is given in substance as written by the
Chief, Mr. G. H. Walker.</p>

<p>The St. Louis division was organized on April 3, 1917.
The initial organization was composed of sixteen companies,
organized each under a captain and lieutenants, divided into
professional, commercial and industrial groups, so as to embrace
all fields of activity. Only dependable and loyal men
were taken into these companies, which ranged in size numerically
from fifty to one hundred and twenty-five each. The
business and financial interests of St. Louis responded generously
to the plan and made possible the marked success
that always attended the division.</p>

<p>Captains, lieutenants and operatives from the outset were
required only to use their eyes and ears and to send in their
reports, through their appropriate superiors, to Mr. G. H.
Walker, the Chief of the division, who in turn submitted such
reports to the Special Agent in Charge, Department of Justice,
at St. Louis. It became evident in the summer months
of 1917, from the increasing number and variety of reports
sent in, that the facilities of the Bureau of Investigation
were wholly inadequate, and that the investigating forces of
the Bureau would require enlargement unless the St. Louis
Division of the American Protective League itself undertook
active investigation of its reports, thus relieving the Bureau
to that extent. It was the same old story of the breaking
down of a most important branch of the Government, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
the prompt, patriotic rallying of our American citizens in
support.</p>

<p>The decision was made, involving the opening of a suite
of offices and the enrollment of a number of competent volunteers
who could give their time to this work. Concurrently
with making this decision, which meant so much
more work, the St. Louis division undertook the formation
of a geographic organization distinct from the company organizations,
members of which were not only required to
report all matters of interest through immediate superiors,
but were also called upon from time to time for auxiliary
investigation work in their respective neighborhoods. The
district organization embraced twenty geographical divisions
within St. Louis proper, there being from twenty-five to
fifty operatives in each division, all of them responsible to
a deputy inspector, who in turn was responsible to an inspector
presiding over four districts. Four districts constituted
a zone. St. Louis County, on the west, was similarly organized,
as were East St. Louis and adjoining towns and
villages in Illinois. In the summer of 1918, East St. Louis
and considerable adjacent territory were separated from the
St. Louis division and created into a distinct division, continuing,
however, in close coöperation with the St. Louis
division.</p>

<p>The increasing volume of work out of St. Louis headquarters
required the active services of approximately fifty operatives,
most of whom had abandoned their personal pursuits
and were giving their entire time to the work of the League.
In addition, two hundred and fifty men in the district organization
were being called upon, more or less regularly, to
undertake active investigations with respect to matters arising
in their respective neighborhoods. The personnel of
the organization was made up of loyal and self-sacrificing
citizens in all walks of life. Much excellent service was
rendered in investigations made at night by those who were
unable to devote other time to the work. Each man did
what he could.</p>

<p>Cases of intense and varying interest were arising daily to
sustain the zeal of this large body of volunteers. One of
the most interesting involved a letter, mailed in St. Louis
March 17, 1917, to “Mr. W. Bernkong, Berlin, Germany,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
which found its way into the St. Louis headquarters and
which appeared to be a code letter written in Greek characters
and words. An inspection of this, and a close following
through of the case in all the hands it reached, will
give a reader some idea of the uncanny sureness of the
United States government experts in deciphering any sort
of blind communication that may come before them.</p>

<p>The average unskilled person could make little out of the
original letter, which was worse than Greek. Interest in
this puzzle deepened when it was discovered that, although
written in Greek characters, Greek scholars to whom it
was submitted were unable to translate it. It was ultimately
sent to the War College in Washington, that House of Mystery,
which in due time returned a German translation, revealing
the fact that Greek letters had been adapted to the
formation of German words. It might still have remained
possible for the real secret of the letter to have been concealed
in an unknown code—as one may learn by reference
to the brief mention of ciphers and codes in an earlier chapter
(See “Arts of the Operatives”). Therefore, a first-class
mystery story, indeed the best detective story of all those
the League chiefs have sent in, still remains for any wise
doctor who can solve it. It is easier to write a “detective
story” than it is to read a cipher and double code, because
a story-writer knows his own answer, whereas in the other
case, no one knows the real answer.</p>

<p>This letter had been stopped in transit in France a few
days after the entrance of the United States into the Great
War. There seemed to be some small hope of finding a clue
to the author through advertising it as an undelivered letter.
While this plan was under contemplation, however, a report
reached headquarters, from an operative, to the effect that
while soliciting Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A. subscriptions in a St. Louis
office building late at night, he had surprised a citizen of
German origin, alone in his office, who appeared to be attempting
to decipher a letter with the aid of two books, seemingly
code books.</p>

<p>The letter was then advertised and two operatives were
assigned to watch the appropriate window at the General
Post Office. After a week’s vigil, the clerk in charge beckoned
to the operatives and pointed to the retreating figure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
of a woman of small stature, almost wholly enveloped in
a black shawl, and informed them that she had inquired for
the Bernkong letter. She had said that she was not the
author but would be glad to pay any additional postage necessary
to send it on its way. In the course of this explanation
the woman had left the building and was lost in the crowd
on the street. It therefore became necessary to continue the
surveillance at the Post Office in the hope of the woman’s
return. Within a week she did reappear, late in the afternoon,
and inquired for mail under the name of a Catholic
Sister. It was learned that she had been receiving mail
under this name for a considerable length of time. She
was followed for a number of blocks and was seen to enter
a large institution conducted as a girls’ rooming house.</p>

<p>A woman operative of the St. Louis Division, American
Protective League, that night, carrying a suit case, applied
at the institution for a room, explaining that she had just
arrived from a nearby city. She had a detailed description
of the woman, but for a period of more than three weeks
she was unable to find anybody in the place fitting the description.
This woman operative was then also assigned to
the Post Office, where, in due time, the woman reappeared.</p>

<p>The operative followed her to the institution, entering the
door only a few moments behind her, and saw her enter a
room on the second floor. A few minutes later the woman
operative was surprised to see the suspect leave her room,
wholly changed in appearance, the black shawl having been
replaced by a dark sack suit and a black sailor hat. As the
woman had that afternoon received a letter at the Post
Office, it was suspected that, as a go-between, she would
deliver this letter to some one. She left the building and
boarded a street car. The woman operative entered a waiting
automobile and followed. Again the mystery woman
proved too elusive. The next morning the woman operative
was up and on guard before daybreak and was enabled to
trail the woman to a business establishment, where, it was
learned, she was employed in clerical work. She was again
dressed in the sack suit and black sailor hat, and apparently
assumed the habit of a nun only upon inquiring at the Post
Office for mail.</p>

<p>The most thorough inquiries failed to reveal any additional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
evidence indicating this woman’s connection with
enemy activities, or solve the dual character she was impersonating.
It was ultimately determined to take her to the
Bureau, where she might be thoroughly interrogated, which
was done. Her explanations were simple but unsatisfying.
However, there was no violation of the law with which she
could be charged, and it was necessary to permit her to go.
She moved to another hotel where the St. Louis division
continued to keep her under surveillance, without, however,
throwing any further light upon the mysterious letter. Other
apparent clues were likewise run down in vain.</p>

<p>The letter bears every evidence of having been a serious
attempt to communicate information of more or less value
to the enemy and appears to permit of further decoding
through the use of some additional cipher. It is by no
means sure that the ultimate code for it will not be found
by some expert government man in Washington. The world
little knows what marvels of unraveling secrets is done in
the Intelligence work of the Government. Always the battle
goes on between those trying to make codes that cannot be
read by an outsider and those who say they can master any
code if given time. In any case, here is a fine detective
story.</p>

<p>Little or no successful attempt was made by St. Louis
Division to keep the organization’s work a secret, and in
a center so large, that always is a moot question. In the
first place, any large operations, like raids and drives cannot
be kept secret, and in the second place, the fear created by
the thought of hidden regulators has proved a valuable deterrent,
as has been shown countless times. In any case, months
ago the local press was “playing up” the League in many
stories that named it very frankly. Since that is true, some
of the anecdotes collected may be given here.</p>

<p>A St. Louis German, with the boastfulness which fortunately
offsets much of the cunning and industry of his
species, bragged to his sweetheart that he was a member of
the Imperial German Secret Service. Perhaps he showed
her the card which German spies are not supposed to show.
She, very proud, confided to a friend her lover’s distinction.
The friend went to one of the local officials of the American
Protective League. She had four brothers in the service,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
three in the Army and one in the Navy, and said that if
there was a German spy in the city the authorities should
know it. Unfortunately, she had forgotten the man’s name.
The man’s room was raided, and evidence was unearthed that
he was not only an unregistered enemy alien, but indeed a
German spy. In his trunk were found firearms of the German
army. He was promptly interned. Perhaps no sweetheart
should have a spy, and certainly no spy should have
a sweetheart.</p>

<p>A German who predicted the defeat of the Allies before the
United States entered the war, persisted in his harangues
afterwards, until a League operative went to the bank where
he worked. The man’s dismissal resulted. He continued
at times to return to the bank, assailing some of the young
women clerks with abuse and threats because of their loyalty
to America. He was arrested for violating his zone permit,
which the United States Marshal had revoked when the
bank’s notice of his dismissal was filed. Later he was interned.</p>

<p>One night a party from the Naval recruiting office in St.
Louis was seeking enlistments at a West End theater. Moving
pictures were thrown on a screen and an officer made a
speech, in which he declared: “The Germans went through
Belgium and France like barbarians.” A stout, well-dressed
man in the audience exploded: “That’s a damned lie!”
Two sailors with revolvers sprang for him over the footlights,
but the first to reach him were two members of the
League, who, although they had gone to the theater only for
amusement, had not forgotten their duties. After a sharp
tussle the disturber was overpowered. He protested indignantly
that he was an American citizen, but refused stubbornly
to give any other information about himself. Borrowing
an automobile, the League operatives and sailors took
him to a police station and notified the Federal authorities.
Search of the prisoner’s effects showed that he was an unnaturalized
German subject, though he had lived in the United
States for fourteen years. He was interned for the duration
of the war. Of such is the glorious Kingdom of
Deutschland.</p>

<p>A client went to the office of his attorney, and after their
business was concluded, tarried for a chat, in which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
dropped the information that he had heard a pro-German
say: “Every American child should have its neck wrung
as soon as it is born. The German army could rule the
United States better than Wilson—and it will, too.” The
lawyer obtained from him the name and address of the offender,
and the names of witnesses who heard his remarks.
After the client had gone, the attorney, being a member of
the League, made out a report on a blank form supplied
by the Department of Justice, and sent it to the Captain of
his company, signing it with his number. The lawyer’s
duty ended here, for he belonged to one of the occupational
units and was pledged to give information but not to investigate.
The Captain took the report to League headquarters,
where the officials approved it and sent it to the local office
of the Department of Justice, Bureau of Information. It
was O.&nbsp;K.’d there as a matter worth looking into, whereupon
the League called upon its other arm, the investigators. They
went out to obtain affidavits to corroborate the hearsay information
first turned in by the lawyer. In this roundabout
way was secured evidence to be placed before the Attorney
General. You can never tell, even if you are a pro-German
and have to spill over, when you are also going to spill, upset
or overturn the legumes known in common parlance as the
beans.</p>

<p>A naturalization department was organized on the initiative
of the St. Louis office, which was followed in other
divisions. On May 18, Congress repealed the law prohibiting
the naturalization of aliens if they had filed declarations
of intention not less than two or more than seven
years before the United States entered the war. That is,
citizenship was possible under these conditions, providing the
applicant established his good moral character, his attachment
to the Constitution, his belief in organized government,
his ability to speak English and the genuineness of
his wish to become a citizen and renounce forever all allegiance
to any foreign Power. About eight hundred persons
in the St. Louis district, according to local press data, sought
to avail themselves of the opportunity provided by the new
law. Their applications called for a thorough investigation
in each case. This work the League volunteered to take off
the shoulders of the Bureau of Naturalization. The inquiries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
put in the questionnaire are interesting as official tests of
loyalty. The most important of them are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Has applicant affiliated himself directly or indirectly with
any organization or propaganda in any way opposed to the
position taken by the United States in regard to the war, or
with known or suspected agents of the enemy?</p>

<p>Has applicant at any time expressed his approval of (a) the
invasion of France and Belgium? (b) the sinking of the
Lusitania? and (c) the general conduct of the war by Germany?
If so, when, where and in whose hearing?</p>

<p>Has applicant been opposed to (a) the United States’ entry
into the war? (b) acts of the United States in conducting the
war (c) shipping munitions to France and England? (d) the
draft? (e) Liberty loans?</p>
</div>

<p>Can all the foreign-born or foreign-descended citizens of
the United States swear before God that they are fit to gain
or to retain their citizenship under a test like that?</p>

<p>A St. Louis journal, in commenting on the work of the
American Protective League in that city, gave a rather interesting
summary of the growth of the espionage idea in the
United States, for which place not inappropriately may be
found here.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The dangers that hung upon the flanks of the nation, the
adroit moves of detective forces which set at naught the
plotters, and the manner and means adopted to nip in the
bud the creeping plans of Pan-Germanism, is one of the most
fascinating and in many respects one of the most thrilling
chapters in the recital of America’s first months in the great
war.</p>

<p>Previous to the Civil War, the United States had no secret
service. It came into being when reports were brought to
Samuel H. Felton, president of the Philadelphia, Wilmington
and Baltimore Railroad, that President Lincoln would be
assassinated while traveling by special train from the West
to his inaugural at Washington. Felton sent for Allan
Pinkerton, who was then conducting a small detective agency
in Chicago. It is interesting to note that Pinkerton, in taking
the task of protecting Lincoln’s life, outlined the method which
is the keynote of the secret service system. In describing the
work he wrote: “I resolved to locate my men at the various
towns along the road where it was believed dissatisfaction
existed. I sent the men to their posts with instructions to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
become acquainted with such men as they might, on observation,
consider suspicious, and endeavor to obtain from them,
by association, a knowledge of their intentions.” Later,
Pinkerton, under the name of “Maj. E. J. Allen,” directed the
intelligence department of Gen. McClellan’s Ohio army.</p>

<p>Brig. Gen. Lafayette C. Baker was the organizer of the
military secret service that performed the detective duty of
the Civil War. At the outbreak of hostilities, a national
detective bureau was an idea entirely new, and was regarded
as contrary to republican institutions. The service went out
of existence with the close of the war.</p>

<p>The present day Secret Service, proper, is a division of the
Treasury Department. It was created at the time “shin
plasters” were in existence and counterfeiting thereof had
become general. Its duty at the outset was to run down counterfeiters,
but later its duties were somewhat broadened, and
in recent years it has been intrusted with the safety of the
President.</p>

<p>In April of this year, the United States had at its command
(besides M.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;D. and Naval Intelligence) the Secret Service,
the investigators of the Department of Justice, the Immigration
Bureau inspectors and the inspectors of the Post Office
Department. These organizations for the detention of criminals
are now working in close harmony against the common
enemy.</p>
</div>

<p>With these agencies also worked the American Protective
League, regarding which this comment was printed and
should be reprinted:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is no exaggeration to say that the American business
men who conceived the plan and who to-day constitute the
myriad meshes in the spy net cast over America, have accomplished
a feat which, for efficiency, for secrecy, for loyalty and
patriotism has never been equaled or approached by the men
of any nation since time began.</p>
</div>

<p>The St. Louis division embraced a membership of 3,000
operatives, the large majority of whom made up the listening
and reporting organization. The number and variety of
cases developed and investigated are as follows: Alien enemy
activities, 225; Espionage Act cases, 1,142; sabotage, 11;
anti-military activities, 15; printed propaganda, 1,741; I. W.
W., including pacifism, 48; bribery, graft, etc., 45; impersonation,
2; naturalization, 600; counter-espionage, 53;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
draft cases, 7,075; character and loyalty investigations, 589;
liquor cases, 49; vice, 26; wireless cases, 52; profiteering, 80;
miscellaneous, 256.</p>

<p>The credit for the patient and self-sacrificing labors required
in this large volume of work is due not only to the
patriotism and fidelity of the listening and reporting force
and to those operatives who devoted their time to work of
investigation, but also to conscientious coöperation of the
district organizations and their deputies and inspectors. Sharing
with these must be remembered, on the silent roll of
honor, all those deputy chiefs in charge of the respective
departments at headquarters under the immediate direction
of their Chief, who must stand for all.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>
THE STORY OF KANSAS CITY</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Gate City of the Great West in the War—If K. C.
Ever was Wild and Woolly, That was Long Ago—Let Us
Have Peace, if We Have to Get It With a Gun—All Quiet
Along the Missouri.</p>
</div>

<p>Kansas City claims and has claimed for a long time the
title of Gate City to the Great West. This is hers by legitimate
right and has been ever since wheel-power first went
west of the Missouri River. Independence, Missouri, which
we may call the mother of the modern Kansas City, was for
years, early in the last century, the jumping-off place for
all the great western transcontinental trails. That way lay
Oregon, on the upper fork. The left fork of the main traveled
road led to Santa Fé. The men bound for the Arkansas
Valley passed by here, and the old fur hunters said good-bye
to civilization at this point even before the wagon had replaced
the pack saddle on the Santa Fé trail. Here began
the wagon-road that later was railroad, and all the time, from
the wildest to the tamest days, whether in staid 1842, or in
wild 1882, Kansas City was the Gate of the West, letting in
and passing out a wild and tempestuous life in the days of
the Homeric West.</p>

<p>Time was when Kansas City was bad, and had her man
for breakfast with the best of them. But always the worst
was farther West, and Kansas City sat tight. She did not
care for the movies of the future, but quickly went in for
law, order and business. So she has grown up, by very
virtue of her geography, her situation, and her history, into
an immense commercial center, solid, law-abiding and prosperous.</p>

<p>There was no reason to expect any great outbreaks of violence
in Kansas City at this date of her history, nor do we
find any; but the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. was there as it has been in every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
other great city of the Union throughout the war. That it
was active may be seen by a glance at the totals. In D.&nbsp;J.
work, forty-five cases of alien enemy activities, 1,237 cases
of disloyalty and sedition, and eight cases of propaganda
cover the list. The War Department offered more work, the
selective draft alone involving under its several heads 3,182
cases. There were 410 investigations connected with character
and loyalty; 227 cases of investigation of civilian applicants
for overseas service. Raids to obtain evidence for
illegal sale of liquor to soldiers brought visits to fifty-three
doubtful saloons, and twenty-five convictions of violators.
Kansas City is dry, so far as the Army is concerned, as may
be witnessed by an editorial of September 17, 1918, in the
Kansas City <i>Star</i>—which also shows why it is dry:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The sale of liquor to soldiers has been going on in Kansas
City for months. Officers at Leavenworth and Funston have
complained of it. The consequences have been apparent to
everybody. Yet the police—Governor Gardner’s police—did
nothing. It took a voluntary organization to get the evidence
and force the arrests. The law-breakers whom the police—Governor
Gardner’s police—could not find, were run down by
the volunteers of the American Protective League. They
discovered the most open and flagrant violation of the law. It
was no trick for amateurs to get evidence and find the people
who deserved arrest.</p>
</div>

<p>A tough North-end colored saloon was visited by A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
operatives late one Saturday evening. A large crowd was
encountered. Most of them had been drinking heavily and
were in rather a noisy condition. The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. men first
encountered a large colored fellow. He explained that he
was past the age, but that he had served in the 21st Kansas
(colored) in the Spanish War, and produced his papers to
prove his assertion. A colored fellow was encountered who
refused to show his card. He said he had one, but stated
he would not go to headquarters and that it would take a
fight to get him there. Whereupon this ex-colored soldier
stepped up and informed him that if there was to be any
threshing done, he asked the first opportunity, and that no. 2
would show his card or he would take it off him. He was
supported by two or three other colored men, with the result<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
that every man in the crowd brought out his card. This
story is given to illustrate one fact—no matter how tough
and disorderly the crowd, eighty-five percent at least still
had manhood enough left to be loyal.</p>

<p>In another saloon a big fellow was leaning on the bar.
He was notified that operatives outside were looking at the
cards, and he said: “I have my little old card right here,”
slapping his breast, “but the man who sees it will first
have to walk over my dead body.” Operative <span class="nowrap">B——</span>, who
had entered the saloon a few minutes before, was leaning
on the bar facing the fellow and when he finished his tirade,
he said quietly and very low: “Let me see your card,
please; I am from the American Protective League”—and
he showed his star. Instantly the fellow replied: “Oh,
certainly, here it is”—accompanied by a roar of laughter
from everybody in the saloon.</p>

<p>A man was reported by neighbors as having taken down a
flag that was put on his house. It was said that he read
the reports of German victories in the early part of the war
on the front porch to the neighbors and gloated over them.
He also said he knew how far to go, what to say and when
to quit. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operatives had a quiet interview with this
party. He was well educated, held a good position, and
was desirous of arguing the question. At that moment he
was reinforced by his wife, who immediately ordered the
operatives out of the house, with the statement that no one
could accuse her husband of being disloyal. She was very
determined and unusually long of wind. His change was
immediate. He took his wife to a back room. Evidently he
runs the house, for she did not reappear. He assured us
he had made a mistake, and, in fact, termed himself a plain
d——d fool. He promised to be loyal and said that he invited
checking up.</p>

<p>It was the experience of the Eastern District of Kansas
City that about twenty percent were American-born citizens
of German descent, or naturalized Germans who looked upon
the war as simply a question of taking sides, instead of a
question of loyalty. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. pointed out to these the need
of being loyal, what they owed this country, why they should
be subservient to the law—and what was going to happen
to them if they were not. This twenty percent either was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
made into good citizens or it remained a class of people who
said nothing and did no harm. The five percent of bad
stuff represented the actual Germans who were interested
in the success of the Germans, and the slackers, deserters
and men who had violated the law and had to be apprehended.</p>

<p>A typical Kansas City case was commented on in the “Spy
Glass,” the national A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. paper:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Fred W. <span class="nowrap">S——</span> was born on March 29, 1888, entered military
service in Crefeld, Germany, October 15, 1909, in the 53rd
Infantry Regiment of the 5th Westphalian Division, Co. 6,
and received his discharge on September 25, 1911. His military
book in addition to giving his record as first-class marksman,
shows that he was recommended for corporal. In April,
1913, he secured a furlough to North America, but was subject
to call in March, 1915. Claims he came to this country to
visit his brother. Interviewed, <span class="nowrap">S——</span> was frank. He stated
that he made it a rule never to talk, but that prior to the
United States entering the war, he had let some remarks
slip to his fellow workmen, which he had regretted, as these
remarks had caused him a great deal of trouble since then.
He showed us his registration card. He stated that he had
applied for his first papers and that he was ready and willing
to take out his last papers the moment he was permitted, and
that he wanted to become an American citizen. He had four
brothers in the German Army, and has not heard from them
for three years. This was given as an explanation for his
mistake in making a few remarks at the beginning of the war.
He asserted that he would live up faithfully to every rule,
would attend strictly to his business and would report whenever
desired. He declared that he had bought First, Second
and Third Liberty Loan Bonds. He also stated that he had
given to the Red Cross. Conclusion: He has violated no
law and do not believe he intends to violate any. Kept under
observation.</p>
</div>

<p>Here is another story which illustrates that curious psychological
bluntness and one-sidedness of the German intellect.
The widow of Fred <span class="nowrap">E——</span>, deceased, who had a drug store,
was asked for a subscription to the hospital fund. She said:
“I won’t give any money to the Research Hospital, but
maybe, if you take the old name back, I will give to the
German Hospital, but not to the Research Hospital.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span></p>

<p>The manner in which she said this and the spirit demonstrated
by her attitude showed that she was thoroughly pro-German.
Operative No. 60 called on the party, and says in
his report:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We charged her with disloyal talking. She stated that she
had done no disloyal talking, and in fact had taken good
care not to talk against the Government in any way; furthermore,
that she had a son in France and if she was against
the Government she certainly would not have allowed him
to go. We then asked her about her statements regarding
the Research Hospital. She stated she had spoken to her
lawyer about it and he had told her it was not so necessary
to change the name of the Hospital as it would be to change
the name of a business. She thought the name should remain
“German” because the Germans had in the beginning founded
the Hospital. We stated that there were no Germans over
here to found it. “Well,” she said, “I mean German-Americans.”
We then stated there were no German-Americans
here, either, but all Americans. She began crying and said
that no one could understand her position, that she had sisters
in Germany and nephews fighting in that Army, while
her own son was in the American Army fighting against them.
She stated that the dirty stories about the German army were
all lies. We told her that it was our duty to demand that
she should not do any talking. We were convinced that she
is very pro-German and that the only way to prevent her from
talking would be to put her where there are no other people
except Germans.</p>
</div>

<p>This is a very fair statement of one of the greatest problems
of America to-day. What shall be done with the hyphen?
It must go, else this war will be fought again.</p>

<p>While the war was yet young, a tip was received from the
draft board that a certain young man had failed to appear
when called. Investigation showed that he had deserted
his wife, leaving her in a destitute condition. He had three
sisters in the city, consequently A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. assumed he would
at some time communicate with one of them. By certain
means, operatives established a watch on the mail as it was
delivered, locating him at different times in Oklahoma, Colorado,
Arizona and other western points. One day a telephone
call was received stating that one of the sisters had
been heard to converse with him over the ’phone; that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
had arrived in town at 2:30, and at 4:00 would be at a certain
place to visit a sister. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. men arrived at that
place. In a few minutes a man of the draft-evader’s description,
wearing a cowboy hat and typical cowboy attire, came
swaggering up the steps. When taken, he put up a somewhat
original and unique story:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You see, I am hard of hearing and have a bad heart. I am
not at all yellow. I am ready to fight at any time, and have
always been ready, but it occurred to me that as I could not
fight on account of my hearing and bad heart, I ought not
put the officials to the trouble of examining me. You see, it
would take a lot of time to examine me, so I thought the best
plan was just to save them that trouble, and as I was going
west anyway, etc.</p>
</div>

<p>Operatives then locked the cowboy up for the night, and
the next morning took him before the Department of Justice.
He was very repentant, and while adhering to the same
story, was anxious that something should be done to keep
him out of the Army. This matter was explained quietly
to the Department man who met him, and upon being advised
by the cowboy that he was hard of hearing, had a bad heart,
etc., the latter said: “I feel awfully sorry for you, but
you see, you are delinquent. You have laid yourself liable
to the law and a penitentiary offense. Now, we usually are
considerate and give a man a chance of going to war, but
you tell me you are hard of hearing and have a bad heart,
and of course, under those circumstances, we cannot send
you to the Army. That is too bad, and I suppose the decision
of the court will be that it is the penitentiary for you.”</p>

<p>A very pale, excited listener immediately said: “Mister,
now I think you misunderstand me. A man who goes
through what I went through yesterday, being arrested and
being locked up with a lot of bedbugs all night, has a fairly
good heart. In fact, I believe I have entirely recovered my
hearing, and am all over the heart trouble. If you will only
let me go to the Army, I will waive all examination.” He
went.</p>

<p>In one day A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. received three different complaints
that a spy was working in the north-eastern part of the city.
He was supposed to be German through and through, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
he had never said anything pro-German. He was generally
considered to be a wise fellow who worked and did not talk.
Every Saturday night he met a bunch of spies in his basement,
one tall and one short, both dangerous looking. They
always carried a secret basket of mysterious contents.
Neighbors were very much aroused. Insisted that the Department
do something, quick. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. placed operatives
on a Saturday night, the night on which these mysterious
meetings all occurred, and watched the long and short men
come with their deadly baskets. Shortly after, a light appeared
in the basement. Curtains were at the windows and
the windows were up, so the operatives crawled up closely and
quietly and listened to the conversation, which was about as
follows, in mixed German: “I played the ace.” “No, you
didn’t, you led with a king!” “You don’t know anything
about playing pinochle.” And so forth. S’nuf, Mawruss.
The mysterious basket contained beer bottles!</p>

THE STORY OF MINNEAPOLIS</h3>

<p>Clean-Cut Work of One of the North-West’s Capitals—Straightaway
Story of a Good Division—Many Anecdotes
Showing How Operatives Worked—The Dignified and
Sober Side of Saving the State and Making Over Citizens—A
Model Report.</p>
</div>

<p>The great city of Minneapolis is one of the foci of the
agricultural and industrial realm of the vast Northwestern
country for which the Twin Cities make the gateway.
It was not to be supposed that its staid and sober population
would cause any great amount of trouble. None the
less, trouble did develop in Minneapolis as elsewhere, and
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. cases and figures mounted steadily upward, just as
they did in other large centers of industry the country over.</p>

<p>Alien enemy cases for the Department of Justice ran
127; disloyalty and sedition, 1,222; sabotage, 17; interference
with draft, 44; propaganda, 392; I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. and
other radicals, 70. War Department cases had 5,725
investigations under the selective draft: 997 slackers; 507
work-or-fight cases; character and loyalty, 337 cases;
liquor, vice and prostitution, 593 cases. The Treasury
Department had 1,129 cases on war risk and allowance
grounds. The Fuel Administration turned over 2,356 cases
for investigation; the gasoline work, 427. The grand total
of cases handled by Minneapolis division men, November
26, 1917, to December 16, 1918, was 15,415.</p>

<p>Minneapolis had a very thorough organization, and has
reported the results in so thorough and explicit a fashion
as to leave small option in matter of handling the report.
It could not well be amended or improved upon, and is
given in substance in the following pages.</p>

<p>Entries on the case cards include every conceivable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
offense against the wartime laws and orders of the Federal
Government. Each card contains the condensed history
of an investigation important in the prosecution of
the war, and, collectively, the 15,415 cards represent
uncountable hours, days and nights of devoted service to
the Government during a period of thirteen months. They
record adventures as thrilling as any of the detective
stories of Monsieur Lecocq or Sherlock Holmes, although
these form a minority of the experiences encountered.</p>

<p>The Minneapolis Division of the American Protective
League entered upon active service November 27, 1917.
An organization with a limited membership had been
effected in Minneapolis previously, but its members served
principally as observers, and it was not until Charles G.
Davis, a Minneapolis contractor, had been induced by
H. M. Gardner, Vice-President of the Civic &amp; Commerce
Association, in charge of war activities, to accept the position
as Chief of the Minneapolis Division, that the American
Protective League became an active local agent for
the apprehension of anti-war activities. Mr. Davis entirely
abandoned his private business to enter upon this important
Government service. After having established relations
with Mr. T. E. Campbell, Chief Special Agent in
charge of the Bureau of Investigation <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Department
of Justice in the Northwest, he opened headquarters and
immediately began recruiting a force of operatives. He
continued in this position through the thirteen months
without salary.</p>

<p>Under the plan of organization, a captain was appointed
in each district and operatives assigned in the numbers
required to meet the conditions encountered. Lieutenants
also were provided, each having charge of groups of operatives
up to ten men. Headquarters held each captain
responsible for all operations in his district.</p>

<p>The jurisdiction of the Minneapolis Division extended
throughout Hennepin County. In the principal county
centers outside of Minneapolis, special operatives were
appointed to take instruction direct from headquarters.
Another group of picked operatives composed a headquarters
squad operated directly under the chief and handling
emergency cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span></p>

<p>Because of the importance and confidential nature of
the business entrusted to the League, extreme care was
exercised in the selection of the operatives. They were
men of proved loyalty as well as of ability and influence.
As the work of the division increased, the personnel was
enlarged until a total of more than four hundred operatives
from all lines of business, trades and professions had
finally been called to service. All served without pay or
expense allowances. Some of them gave practically their
entire time to the work of the League. Most of them definitely
pledged and gave from six to twenty hours of service
every week.</p>

<p>The total members sworn in numbered 491 on November
30, 1918. The active list at that date included 326 officers
and operatives and sixty members of the so-called “Eye
and Ear” division, consisting of men not able to render
continuous service, but so situated that they were in a
position to communicate to headquarters reports of anti-American
activities and other Federal offenses. Among
the active members were scores who had tried in vain to
enter the Army or Navy, and who, failing to find any
other essential war service open to them, found an outlet
for their patriotic energy in the ranks of the American
Protective League. Notwithstanding this, the League
report shows that twenty-four members resigned during
the thirteen months to go into the army; five to enter the
overseas service of the Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A. or Red Cross; and
eighteen to accept other Government service.</p>

<p>In the pursuit of their duties, operatives and officials
of the Minneapolis Division, A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L., arrested several well-known
criminals, and encountered scores of desperate
offenders of various kinds. It is a tribute to their courage
and efficiency that there was not a single case of extreme
violence. Men who were recognized everywhere as dangerous
were apprehended as easily as persons who had
offended unwittingly. In its work, the League employed
all of the scientific as well as the ordinary devices utilized
in the detection and conviction of violators and evaders
of the law. Dictaphones and disguises were used, and
miles were covered and hours spent in skillful “shadowing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span></p>

<p>While the files of the Minneapolis Division contain records
of many cases of extreme importance, including participation
in two investigations which led to the internment
of alien enemies, the conviction of eleven offenders against
the espionage laws, the capture and conviction of numerous
deserters and the successful prosecution of other offenders,
Chief Davis and his associates take greater pride in
the results of constructive work of another type. This
included the re-establishment with their boards of 4,479
delinquents under the selective service regulations, and
the apologies and promises to mend their ways obtained
from men and women who, in some cases, had deliberately,
but in most instances unwittingly, extended aid and comfort
to the enemy. It is estimated that at least two hundred
men and women, who had been guilty of spreading
false reports or of other conduct of an unfriendly nature,
were shown the fallacy of their actions in such a manner
that they voluntarily surrendered their previous ideas and
embraced Americanism with more—or less—zeal.</p>

<p>For the protection of active members, who frequently
encountered emergencies requiring authoritative action,
and often were obliged to make immediate arrests to insure
the detention of persons guilty of serious offenses, an
arrangement was made whereby a large percentage of the
operatives were formally deputized as special officers of
the Minnesota Public Safety Commission. This gave them
sufficient police authority to cope with any situation which
arose. But for this, it would not have been possible for
the organization to make its record of important arrests.
This authority permitted the carrying of arms for protection,
and although instances where “gun play” was
required were few, the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Department of Justice and
the Minnesota Public Safety Commission had no occasion
to regret the authority and responsibility conferred upon
these men. They were enabled, by virtue of this authority,
to enter many places, which otherwise might have been
closed to them, in time to correct conditions which, if
neglected, would have given rise to serious difficulties.</p>

<p>The Minneapolis Division American Protective League
was the first local division to attempt a large-scale slacker
round-up. The results and experience of the Minneapolis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
raids were responsible for similar activities in other cities,
which put into the Army hundreds of men who otherwise
might have evaded military service. The first organized
slacker “raid” in Minneapolis took place on March 26,
1917. One hundred and twenty operatives were employed
in hauling the drag-net through the cheaper hotels in the
Gateway lodging house district. Approximately one hundred
men were taken to the temporary detention place,
and twenty-one men—deserters, unregistered enemy aliens
and men whose draft status could not be determined—were
sent to the county jail.</p>

<p>On April 6, two hundred and fifty operatives, with two
hundred National Guard escorts, visited saloons, cafés,
pool rooms and dance halls, starting at 8:00 p. m. and
continuing until 10:00 p. m., and picked up 1,150 men in
various places. The Chief and a corps of assistants conducted
the questioning throughout the night. There were
still two hundred men in custody when breakfast was
served Sunday morning. Long distance telephone and
the telegraph were employed to determine the status of
the non-residents. Twenty-seven men were locked up.
Other less extensive raids were conducted through the
spring and summer of 1918 and at different periods, squads
of operatives being stationed at the various railroad stations
to search for draft evaders. As many as twenty
prisoners were taken in these stations in a single day, and
it was seldom that a day passed which did not yield two
or more deserters or delinquents.</p>

<p>One morning a dapper individual who arrived at one
station was asked if he had his draft card.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” he replied, reaching confidently into his
pocket. The smile gradually disappeared from his face
and he delved into pocket after pocket without finding the
necessary credentials. Finally he gave up in despair and
admitted he did not have his card. He was an exception
to the rule, however, and did not become indignant. He
said, “Take me along—I deserve it.” At headquarters
he proved to be “Chick” Evans of Chicago, national open
golf champion of the United States. He had come to Minneapolis
to participate in a golf foursome for the benefit
of the Red Cross! He waited fully two hours until a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
telegram was received from his Board in Chicago stating
that he was in good standing.</p>

<p>Another spectacular raid conducted by the Minneapolis
Division was on the show lot of the Ringling Circus.
Thirty men were taken into custody on charges of draft
irregularities, and nearly all of these were inducted into
the army. It was reported that resistance might be offered,
and precautions had been taken in the arrangements for
the raid. No difficulty was encountered, however, and
later in the day the proprietor of the circus complimented
us on the manner in which the round-up had been conducted.</p>

<p>A different type of raid was undertaken at the request
of commandants of the various Army detachments in and
near Minneapolis. They complained that a number of
imposters in army uniforms were bringing discredit to the
soldiery and requested that these be apprehended. There
were so many soldiers on leave in Minneapolis at all hours
that it had been found extremely difficult to identify the
imposters, and so it was decided that with the coöperation
of the various commandants a literal drag-net process
should be resorted to on a given evening. Forces of operatives
were stationed at opposite extremes of the central
business district. More than two hundred men participated,
squads being formed, and one squad being stationed
at each end of each street. The operatives stopped every
uniformed man who was encountered and demanded his
pass. An even dozen uniformed men who did not have
passes were picked up and turned over to Army and Navy
authorities, who attended in automobiles. For a long time
there was an entire absence of reports of offenses on the
part of imposters in service uniforms.</p>

<p>Early in the summer a system of nightly A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. patrols
was established in the down-town section of Minneapolis.
Operatives worked in squads of two or three men, some
of them giving attention to draft evaders, others to the
work-or-fight order, and others to bootleggers. Scarcely
a night passed without a record of one or more important
arrests, and the entire personnel of the League became
intimately acquainted with the down-town business and
social structures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span></p>

<p>In the conduct of these nightly patrols a special headquarters
was established in a down-town public building.
The captain in charge directed operations from this place.
Not only was he able to keep the railroad stations, hotels,
cafés, saloons and other public places under continuous
surveillance for slackers, but he also had forces constantly
available to meet any emergencies which arose during the
evenings. Squads frequently were dispatched from this
headquarters to various points of the city to give attention
to special cases.</p>

<p>One of the first draft evasion cases investigated by the
Minneapolis Division is a great short story ready-made.
It concerned a young man prominent in labor circles. He
had been an avowed opponent of all the national war
measures, and was particularly bitter in his condemnation
of the Selective Service Act. It was reported on good
authority that although he was within the draft age he had
declined to register and intended to resort to any device
necessary to evade service.</p>

<p>The first inquiry was made at the Board of Health,
where it was ascertained that no record of his birth was
on file. Attention was next called to the poll books, and
it was found that the age he had given when registering
as a voter placed him safely within the provisions of the
draft act. His school enrollment record was investigated
and it was found that the ages given in the various grades
made him amenable to the draft. He had three insurance
policies, and the original applications which he had signed
showed him to have been less than thirty-one years old on
June 5, 1917. The last step was to search for the marriage
record of his father and mother. They were found to have
been married in a small town near Minneapolis in November,
1885.</p>

<p>When the young man was summoned to headquarters
he admitted the authenticity of all these records, but
insisted that he knew he was past thirty-one on June 5,
1917. He refused to state on what information he based
this assertion, and was held for prosecution. One final
attempt was made to clear his status, and with considerable
effort his mother, who had divorced his father more than
twenty-five years before, was located. At the end of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
unsatisfactory interview lasting nearly an hour she finally
broke down and in tears admitted the boy had been born
out of wedlock and that she had been responsible for the
falsification of the records in order to indicate his legitimacy.
She said that she had withheld this secret even
from the subject, not divulging to him until a few days
before the day of registration and then only because he
seemed so bitter over the fact that he must register. Her
appearance was so venerable and her determination to
assist him so emphatic that there appeared little chance
of successful prosecution, so the man was released. Headquarters
never received any further reports of un-American
activities on his part.</p>

<p>A later case of interest involved an admitted deserter,
both from the German and the United States Army.
Whether he is guilty of other offenses has not yet been
determined. On September 12, 1918, the day of registration
for men up to forty-six years of age, two operatives
on duty were struck by the peculiar actions of a man who
appeared to register. They managed to get near him without
attracting suspicion. In stating his occupation he said
he was an iron moulder. They noticed that his hands were
soft and white. When he left the registration place, one
of the operatives followed him. The other telephoned to
the plant where the man had said he was employed and
learned that he was not known there. The individual was
“shadowed” to a lodging house, but had departed while
the first operative was telephoning. The house was put
under surveillance, and after a period of five days the
operative gained entrance and searched his room. Among
his effects were blank checks from banks in various cities,
photographs in German army uniforms of a man recognizable
as the subject, and various letters and pamphlets
in German, some of which were suspicious. Under the
carpet in the room was an official United States Army
discharge blank.</p>

<p>The fact that this paper had been so carefully hidden
caused further suspicion, and the watch was maintained
for another five days, when a man appeared at the house
seeking to rent the room which had been occupied by the
subject. He described the particular room. On instructions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
from the operatives, the landlady let him have it.
When he entered the room he started packing the effects
of the subject, and shortly afterwards left the house with
the subject’s two suitcases. He was stopped outside and
questioned. He said a man had given him $5.00 to go to
that lodging house, to rent that particular room, to get
his belongings and to meet him at a certain place the following
morning, where he agreed to give him $50. This
man was held over night and was sent out the next day
to make the appointment arranged by the subject. The
subject was there and was taken into custody. After a
gruelling examination he admitted being a deserter from
the United States Army. He later confessed that he was
a German alien and said he also had deserted from the
army in Germany. He would not account for his activities
in the months which had elapsed between his desertion
from the Army and his capture in Minneapolis. He had
a considerable sum of money, but could not prove he had
done any work. He was turned over to the military
authorities.</p>

<p>Topping all other humorous experiences was that
encountered by one of the most efficient of the Minneapolis
District A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. Captains. He had orders to arrest
a deserter who bore a Polish name ending in “-ski.” After
a long search he was informed that this man lived in one
of the slum sections, working all day and arriving at his
lodging place generally about 1:00 a. m. He could not
learn where the man worked and so was compelled to
locate him at his room. Going there to make inquiries
one night, he was told that the man was there. Having
been informed that the fellow was dangerous and fearing
that he would become alarmed and flee if he was not taken
into custody immediately, the captain went into his room.
Asking if he were “So-and-so-ski,” the man said he was.
He was told to get up and dress and come along. Although
he was surly he showed no resistance and accompanied the
captain outside. The captain felt, however, that this docility
might be assumed, and thought he would take no
chances. The place was about a mile from the jail. The
captain had an automobile, but did not feel it would be
safe to take the prisoner in the seat with him. He therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
compelled him to straddle the hood on the car, and
on this ungainly perch, with the temperature 20° below,
the unfortunate suspect was driven to the court house.
Arriving there, the prisoner scratched his head and asked:</p>

<p>“What yuh bringin’ me down here for?”</p>

<p>“Why, because you didn’t register for the draft. You
know what.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t register for the draft? I guess I did! Here
is my blue card and my classification card.”</p>

<p>Explanation followed. This man’s name ended with the
Polish “-ski” and was otherwise almost identical to the
name of the culprit who was sought. When he was asked
if he was “So-and-so-ski,” it sounded so much like his
own name that he admitted it. He was taken back to his
lodgings in the seat beside the captain and proper apologies
were made.</p>

<p>In most cases where humor existed, there was sometimes
a mixture of tragedy. There was one man, a motor truck
driver, who had made himself exceedingly popular with
a number of women by wearing a uniform of an infantryman
without having gone through the formality of enlistment.
He was captured one day while paying a call on
one of his admirers. Operatives burst in upon the imposter
and told him he must straightway doff the uniform.</p>

<p>“But this is the only suit of clothes I have,” he protested.
One operative went to his truck and found an
oil-stained suit of overalls. He was taken behind the screen
and forced to get into these and give up his military
raiment.</p>

<p>Another incident of this kind involved a young man
who was subject to draft and who said he was ready to
respond when called. He could not wait the Government
issue of clothes, however. He went to a tailor and equipped
himself with a suit of khaki which fitted perfectly and
further adorned himself with the insignia of the Artillery
Service and an officer’s sleeve braid. When he was summoned
to headquarters, he explained that he intended to
take this uniform to camp to wear when “he went to
town.” His readiness to wear the uniform was communicated
to his draft board by telephone and brought
orders for immediate induction. Although he had sold all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
of his civilian clothes, one suit was recovered from the
second-hand dealer who had purchased them, and he went
to camp in it.</p>

<p>One Saturday night a young man of stentorian voice,
wearing classical shell-rimmed glasses, appeared at a
prominent down-town corner, mounted a soap-box and
shouted, “Step closer, gentlemen. I have no bombs, no
T.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;T., no lyddite, no dynamite or powder explosives of
any kind. Step closer though and I’ll treat you to some
talk-bombs.” In the vanguard of those who stepped closer
were two A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operatives. Five minutes later the
orator, Herbert Blank, alias Herbert <span class="nowrap">C——</span>, deserter
from the British army, was registered at the county jail.
The shell-rimmed glasses and his predilection to Bolsheviki
oratory had proved his downfall. They had been mentioned
in a bulletin asking his apprehension, sent out from
Chicago headquarters of the Department of Justice and
received that morning in Minneapolis headquarters.</p>

<p>The leading man of the theatrical company which scored
the biggest hit of any troupe playing Minneapolis last winter
applied his cold cream and other theatrical embellishments
for his Saturday matinee performance under the
eyes of an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operative whilst he confessed to the
operative that it was quite possible that he should have
registered for the draft, although he had not. At the
request of the New York A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. headquarters, this man
was examined, and although he carried with him a sworn
statement from his father to the effect that he had been
born prior to June 5, 1886, coöperation with the Toledo
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. had developed evidence that this was not true.
Before the interview was concluded, ample evidence was
secured to warrant the arrest of the actor, but his role was
so prominent and there was such a certainty that the company
would be compelled to cancel all of its engagements
with distinct losses to all its members, that mercy was
shown and he was allowed to continue the performance
until such a time as his draft status could be adjusted.
For several weeks, during the travels of the company, he
was compelled to report daily at the offices of the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span>
Department of Justice in the various cities visited.</p>

<p>One night a squad of operatives, led by the Chief, visited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
an apartment in a down-town building to investigate a
report that liquor was being served to soldiers and sailors.
When they gained entrance they found no uniformed men
upon the premises, but one of the operatives who had
lived in San Francisco recognized the unmistakable odor
of opium smoke. He said, “Hop, Chief!” A search was
made and a large quantity of opium was found secreted
in various nooks of the apartment. Further search revealed
twenty-three sticks of dynamite, a complete kit of burglar’s
tools, a supply of saws and other devices used by crooks.
A bolt of silk and other new merchandise, afterwards identified
as property stolen from stores, also was uncovered.
Five men and a woman were taken to jail.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting cases was that of a German
who left Germany fifty-six years ago, at the age of six
years. He went to South Dakota, where he prospered
greatly, and moved to Minneapolis about fifteen years ago.
At the outbreak of the war his remarks were such that
his business associates and social acquaintances practically
ostracized him, and the members of his lodge preferred
charges of disloyalty against him. The man was brought
to headquarters. Members of his lodge were invited to
be present, and he was given twenty minutes seeing himself
as others saw him. His attitude at first was stubborn
and defiant. The Chief then began to dwell on the suffering
of his children; said they were refused admittance to
fraternities, were not invited to parties and that his boy
departed for the mobilization camp brokenhearted and in
tears over the fact that none of his family were at the
station to bid him good-bye at the most important milestone
in his career. This line of talk seemed to soften the
subject. He broke down and said, with tears: “I never
was talked to like this before in my life, but I never had
anything said to me that did me so much good. Will you
please shake hands with me?” After that his fellow
lodge members affected a reconciliation on the spot. This
man’s future conduct was above reproach after this incident,
and he became one of the most active workers for
the Red Cross and Liberty Loan.</p>

<p>A well known clairvoyant and spiritualist medium of
Minneapolis was brought into the office by one of the District<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
Captains. She was told that she had been talking
sedition, and waxed indignant at the idea of anybody accusing
her of sedition when she was a woman so far removed
from ordinary planes, who could see into vast rounds of
space. Her complacency was seriously jarred when
informed that one of our operatives had crawled into her
basement through the coal chute and listened to her seditious
talk. Her inability to see into the basement caused
her to have renewed faith in the long arm of Uncle Sam.</p>

<p>A bond salesman earning $10,000 a year was only two
weeks under thirty-one years of age on the 5th of June,
1917. A report came in from a former sweetheart who
had been jilted. Operatives found where the subject had
made application for two insurance policies, taken out two
or three years previous, in another city, which gave his
age and place of birth. When brought into the office, the
man stated that no authentic birth record was in existence,
and that his birth was recorded in the family Bible in a
Southern city, in the custody of his mother. Not having
the address of his mother, that angle not having been covered,
we anticipated that he would attempt to communicate
with his mother. The wires were covered and a message
was picked up about thirty minutes after subject had
left the office instructing the mother to destroy the family
birth record page in the Bible and to send him an affidavit
that he was born a year earlier than he was. Needless
to say, the local operatives in that district where his mother
lived secured the necessary legal data. We hope that this
young man has done more for his country during the
months he has been in France than he did previously as
far as being a patriotic American is concerned. Incidentally,
he felt so secure in his position that during the spring
months of 1918 he had married.</p>

<p>A man and woman occupying a small cottage in the
outskirts of the city were reported as acting in a very
suspicious manner, keeping the windows carefully covered,
not allowing anyone to come into the house, and not even
allowing the meter readers to get in until after considerable
delay. Boxes of glass of a small size were delivered very
often, and investigation at the glass house showed that
they always paid cash, would not give any name, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
always received the supplies at the front porch, and that
the same practice was indulged in about the delivery of
hardware, small orders of lumber, and other materials.
The house was carefully watched for a couple of weeks,
and many attempts were made to get in. The sound of machinery
could be heard and one of the operatives who finally
got in as a meter reader reported a small electric motor in the
basement which seemed to be some sort of a work shop. The
man and woman who lived there kept so close to his heels
that he was not able to do much without exciting suspicion.
At regular intervals the couple visited the post office,
where they shipped packages to different addresses
throughout the Northwest. These packages were registered,
and they seemed to be very careful in their handling
of them. It was decided that we had best pick them up
on the street and bring the couple to the office when they
had these packages in their possession, and the operative
would follow. Examination of the packages in the office
disclosed the fact that there were small framed pictures
which this man and woman were manufacturing and sending
to the woman’s husband, who was on the road selling
them. This satisfactorily explained the mysterious packages
which were thought to be infernal machines. The
queerness of this woman in always carrying a small leather
traveling bag prompted us to examine the contents of
the bag, which proved to be a large amount of money
which this woman was carrying openly through the street
of Minneapolis, part of it in coins. When reprimanded
for this matter of taking the money around with her, she
explained that they were Danish and did not understand
American customs very well. While living in Chicago
they had deposited the savings of several years in a private
bank which failed, and ever since that time they had kept
their savings constantly on their persons. We explained
the banking system to them and sent them to a fellow
countryman, who is the vice-president of one of our large
banks. They left their money in his custody, except a
considerable portion which they invested in Liberty Bonds.</p>

THE STORY OF NEW ORLEANS</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in the Sunny South—Strong Division of the
Crescent City—How the League was Organized—Rapid
Growth and Wide Activities—Curbing of Vice—Cleaning
Up a City.</p>
</div>

<p>There is not in all the United States a more lovable
city than that founded by Iberville, in an earlier century,
above the Delta of the Mississippi. At first French, then
part Spanish, part American, all Southern and yet all
cosmopolitan, New Orleans has what we may call a personality
not approached by any other community on this
continent. Up to the time when, a decade or so ago, the
once self-contented South began to reach out for a commercial
future, so-called, New Orleans was the true Mecca
on this continent of the Northern tourists. No need to
go to Europe if one wanted different scenes. Here existed
always the glamour of old-world customs, an atmosphere
as foreign as it was wholly delightful. As the home of
easy living and good cooking, as the place of kindly climate
and gentle manners, all flavored with a wholesome
carelessness as to life and its problems, New Orleans was,
to use a very trite expression, in a class quite by herself.
She never has had a rival, and more is the pity that the
old New Orleans has succumbed to the modern tendency
towards utilization and change which has marked all
America.</p>

<p>Of such a community it might be expected that none
too rigid a view of life and law would obtain. This would
not be true of the better elements of New Orleans, yet
it was in part true of all the life along the old Gulf Coast,
where Lafitte and all his roisterers once lived, and where
all the gentleness and ease of nature tended toward what
we might call loose living—or at least <i>joie de vivre</i>. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
soul of New Orleans came out annually in her Mardi Gras—the
exuberant flowering of a spirit perennially young
and riante.</p>

<p>And yet to New Orleans came the sobering days of the
war, as to all the rest of America. The conscription fell
upon her as upon every other city in America; and she
also was asked to open her purse for the furtherance of
the war and its purposes. How she responded need not
be asked, and need not really be recorded, for New Orleans
has always maintained beneath her laughing exterior as
stern a sense of duty as may be found anywhere in all the
world. To be French is to smile—but to be firm. Indeed,
New Orleans showed one of the strange phenomena of
American life which is not always known in the North—the
truth that the South is more Puritan than ever
New England was. Texas, supposed to be a bad border
state, to-day has stronger laws regarding vice and liquor
than New England ever has had since the time of the
Blue Laws, and more strictly enforced. Louisiana also,
gentle and kindly, has a stiffer code of morals than any
commonwealth of the stern and rockbound coast. She
smiles—but stands firm.</p>

<p>These reflections become the more obvious as one reads
the main story of the activities of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in New Orleans.
The division does not pride itself ever so much upon its
promptness with Liberty Loans, its activity in slacker
drives, its firmness as to sabotage and propaganda, as it
does upon other phases of work which at first were incidental
to the prosecution of the Government war activities.
The great boast of the New Orleans division is that it has
kept young soldiers away from bad women, and kept
women, once evil, away from themselves and gave them
a chance to reform and to live a different life. So, therefore,
one who shall study all the manifold activities of
the American Protective League in this country will see
that it had many ways in which it rendered service to the
people. Perhaps, long after the League shall have been
dissolved, in part forgotten, the New Orleans rehabilitation
home, ten miles out from the city, will remain as a
monument to the activities of that singular organization
which, like King Rex himself, ruler of the Carnival, came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
from some mysterious region and vanished thence again,
leaving behind only good memories.</p>

<p>On January 29, in 1918, the New Orleans division of
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. had only thirty-eight members. At that time Mr.
Charles Weinberger became manager, there being associated
with him as assistant chief Mr. Arthur G. Newmyer.
There were at first but limited office quarters, but in a
very short time new headquarters were established and the
plant installed covering approximately ten thousand square
feet of space. This was on April 1, 1918. On February 1,
1919, the total membership was 2,097.</p>

<p>League operations were distributed under a Bureau of
Investigation and a Bureau of Information, each in charge
of an assistant chief. The investigation work was divided
by Special D.&nbsp;J. Agent Beckham as follows: Headquarters
bureau, handling enemy alien activities, disloyalty, sedition,
propaganda, etc., had two units, a staff of eighty-three
headquarters lieutenants, and also a ward organization.
In each of the seventeen wards of New Orleans there was
a lieutenant who had enough operatives under him to cover
his neighborhood thoroughly.</p>

<p>The second bureau, that of Information, took up on its
part the trades classification rather than that which we
may call the geographical classification into city districts.
There was a captain in each of the seventy-eight commercial
lines of the city, and each captain had lieutenants and
operatives in his particular line of business. In this way
there was what might be called a double covering of the
city, both as to information and investigation. For
instance, in each hotel there would be a captain, lieutenant
and operatives. The Bureau of Information had entire
charge of the financial end of the League, and it supplied
men to the Investigation Division for the purpose of raids,
or for whatever matter required special assistance.</p>

<p>In the War Department work, the selective service
bureau was in charge of a captain with proper assistants,
who handled all violations under Section 6 of the Act. A
member of this bureau was detailed with each exemption
board, and this division handled all the draft investigations.
It made a great many searches of this sort, prevented
a great many evasions, and corrected many incorrect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
classifications. In the slacker raids which New
Orleans had in common with practically every other big
city of the country there were sometimes as many as three
hundred operatives employed, and it is estimated that
more than 20,000 slacker investigations were made in all.</p>

<p>New Orleans was a “wet town,” in close proximity to
two Naval stations, three aviation fields, and two cantonments.
It is easily seen what this meant in the way of
activities for the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. There was a special liquor
bureau put in charge of a captain and assistants. The
division Chief and his aids made an agreement with all
the local breweries and all the wholesale and retail liquor
dealers that no intoxicating liquor should be sold in bottles
after 7:00 p. m. This cut off a great deal of bootlegging
and much of the heavier drinking which could not be
controlled by the local police. This bureau was most efficient,
as is demonstrated by the fact that Colonel Charles
B. Hatch, <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Marines, who was in charge of the police
forces of Philadelphia, was sent down to New Orleans by
Secretary Daniels of the Navy to make an investigation
of the New Orleans situation, and reported that so long
as the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. was on the job there was no need for the
establishment of a military police in New Orleans, or of
extending any other law-enforcing organization. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
has rarely had a better compliment than this.</p>

<p>This bureau had chemists making analyses of several
alleged soft drinks, and caused a cessation in their sale
when they were of a suspicious character. In general, it
locked up the town in a manner entirely satisfactory to
the military and naval authorities. Anyone going to New
Orleans in war times would have found it anything but a
wide-open place.</p>

<p>Yet, but lately, New Orleans was called rather an “open
town” in other ways: hence the vice bureau, established
under the constant personal supervision of the division
Chief. There were squads kept out all the time in control
of the “district” and uptown sections of the city,
this patrol being kept up day and night. It was not in
the least infrequent that A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. men would be out many
nights on service of this sort.</p>

<p>In order that the operations of this vice bureau might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
be facilitated, Chief Weinberger was named <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Commissioner
by Federal Judge Foster. Women apprehended
under Section 13 of the Conscription Act were brought
before Commissioner Weinberger, their cases investigated
and affidavits made. When necessary, they were sent to
the isolation hospital for investigation as to their physical
status.</p>

<p>In order to prevent sending these unfortunate women to
jail with criminals, the American Protective League at New
Orleans engaged in the enterprise earlier referred to—its
“Amproleague Farm.” Here there were ample dormitories,
fully equipped, and a garden was maintained.
There was a matron in charge. The place was kindly
and helpful in every way, and every attempt was made
to change the women spiritually as well as physically during
their stay. Thus the League went a step further than
acting simply as a merciless police force. It took care of
young men who ought to have taken better care of themselves,
but it did more. It took care not of one sex alone,
but of both sexes, and in the truer and more lofty sense
of the word.</p>

<p>In this operation of the liquor and vice bureaus, local
Army and Navy camps detailed men to help the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
The local organization of the Home Guard, to the number
of about a hundred, were admitted to membership in the
League also. This organization, which was under military
discipline, could be quickly assembled for night service.
Transport of the League was cared for by the automobile
division of the Bureau of Information. The latter men
rendered special service to prevent the shipment of liquor
into dry territory, whether in violation of the Reed
Amendment or in violation of Section 12 of the Conscription
Act. The New Orleans district had one neighboring
cantonment which was in dry territory.</p>

<p>In brief, New Orleans showed what all the divisions of
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. did throughout the country—good judgment and
common sense. It did the thing necessary to be done, the
most obvious and most useful thing. That duty was the
caring for the personnel of the soldiers and sailors grouped
in such numbers in or close to New Orleans. Human
nature was accepted as human nature, and dealt with as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
such. These are the conditions which perforce colored the
work of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in New Orleans. They do not reflect the
average community life of that city in any ordinary sense
of the word, although many of the cases most valued by
the Division itself have had to do with that manner of
work.</p>

<p>For instance, the vice bureau apprehended two young
women under Section 13 of the Conscription Act. Brought
before the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Commissioner, they were released upon
their personal recognizance, but failed to appear on the
next morning. Later they were located in Houston, Texas,
and brought back to New Orleans. They were not kicked
down. They found homes at the “Amproleague Farm.”</p>

<p>Matters did not go so gently in the vice operations so
far as they had to do with the older and more persistent
offenders. There were raids on some of the more notorious
resorts, and several of them closed their doors entirely.
There was a general cleaning up in New Orleans which
was good for the city whether or not it remained a center
of military activities.</p>

<p>A common practice of New Orleans taxicab drivers was
to meet all trains coming in from the cantonments and
to offer the sights of the city, liquor and taxicab included,
to any enlisted man for a net sum varying from five to ten
dollars. The League practically wiped out this pernicious
practice by putting on the trains A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. men in uniform
as soldiers. When they got off the train and were thus
accosted by taxicab drivers, they had all the evidence
which was necessary. The taxicab practice was seriously
interfered with.</p>

<p>A neighboring city was alleged to have examined incorrectly
before its draft board a certain young man, giving
him a classification to which he was not entitled. Investigation
was set on foot by the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L., who uncovered the
fact that the man’s father conducted a sanitarium patronized
by drug and liquor patients. He had treated several
members of the board in his sanitarium, and had likewise
had the Federal district judge as a patient, as well as
several other influential citizens of the community. Thus,
having rather confidential information, A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. had very
little difficulty in framing up its case.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
It will perhaps not be necessary to go into the usual
series of narratives of interesting cases in the instance of
the Crescent City. The report, as outlined above, is so
different in its general phases from that of the average
division that it may be allowed to stand, with the addition
of its tabulated totals, which cover all the forms of assistance
to the Government in which A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. has participated
throughout the United States.</p>

<p class="p2">The decision to demobilize the American Protective
League was arrived at somewhat suddenly, for reasons
more or less obvious to all members of the League. As
recently as November 13, 1918, Mr. Bielaski, Chief of the
Bureau of Investigation of the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Department of Justice,
wrote to Chief Weinberger, expressing the assurance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
that the American Protective League by no means ought
to disband, since peace was not yet declared, and since
need for the League’s services still existed. He said, “I
am entirely satisfied that the need for this organization will
continue for some time to come, entirely without regard
to the progress of peace negotiations. The tremendous
machines which have been organized by the Government
for the prosecution of this war cannot be stopped abruptly,
and must continue to operate for many months under any
circumstances. The American Protective League has a
large share of the work in this country which has made
possible the united support and the full success of our
arms abroad, and I am sure that your organization will
continue to play its full part until the Department is willing
to say that it has no further need for its services.”</p>

<p>Now, a few months after these expressions, the League
is dissolved and its work declared ended. Is it ended?
New Orleans thinks not, and points at least to one instance
of civic betterment which has not yet demobilized—its
“Amproleague Farm.” The officials found there an old
sugar plantation which dated back to 1857. The old residence
was built over as a modern home, equipped with
forty windows, a dormitory with fifty beds, a room with
six sewing machines, also ample galleries and well-fitted
kitchens. Here the League has built a little community
home which it is not yet ready to see die. It is a home
where an erring person is given a chance to begin over
again. And after all, has not that been a part of all the
work of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in all the country? From time to time
in other reports we have seen it stated: “We tried to
show this or that pro-German where he was wrong”;
“We tried to change rather than to punish”; “We
endeavored to improve our citizenship rather than penalize
those who had made mistakes.” So, therefore, we may
say that New Orleans has added a good chapter to the
good history of this body of thoughtful citizens—it has
helped make the world and the country better than it was
before.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>
THE STORY OF CALIFORNIA</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A Series of Graphic Case Stories from All Over the Golden
State—Stirring Romances from the Capital of Romance—The
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara,
San Diego, and Everywhere Between—the Pacific Coast
in War Times.</p>
</div>

<p>Time was when there were just two really cosmopolitan
towns in the United States. Merely being mixed in population
does not mean cosmopolitanism; but San Francisco
and New Orleans were two towns which could offer any
American something to see. The fire changed San Francisco
to a certain extent, and the North has ruined New Orleans
all it could; but the soul of each of these two towns still
goes marching on, incapable of destruction. If sudden
wealth could not make San Francisco avaricious, nor solid
prosperity leave her sordid; if earthquake, fire and famine
could not daunt her unquenchably buoyant heart—what
reason have we to believe that a small matter like a world
war would much disturb her poise?</p>

<p>‘Frisco by the Golden Gate—that last viewpoint where
America faces the Orient and her own future as well—took
her war philosophically, allowed her Hindu conspiracies to
run their course, and viewed with none too great agitation
the flood of disloyalty which inevitably was caught by the
western shore, just as once a better sort of material was
caught in the sluices of her old Long Toms. San Francisco
knows she is here to stay, and believes that this Republic also
is here to stay.</p>

<p class="center">
<i>The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in San Francisco</i><br>
</p>

<p>That there would be an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. organization in San Francisco
admitted of no doubt. The city was ably organized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
and certainly took able care of Fritz and his Boche-loving
friends. But all California is divided into three parts:
Northern California, Southern California—and all California!
An offense to one means a fight for all, although
each allows a certain amount of thumb-biting on the part of
a native son. The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in California followed precisely
this ancient line of cleavage, so that there was established
a Northern Division, a Southern Division—and a State Inspectorship!
The State Inspector was Mr. Douglas White,
who himself is a traveling man, and therefore cannot be accounted
as belonging to either North or South. Mr. A. J.
DeLamare had the division office in San Francisco, where
the organization so closely followed the general lines already
described in other cities that it perhaps is not needful to
go into details here.</p>

<p>That California’s polyglot population meant potential
trouble may be seen in the heads of the Frisco reports: a
total of 1,612 cases of disloyalty and sedition, 277 cases of
propaganda, and 105 of radicalism, such as that of I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.,
etc. The work for the war boards—slackers, desertion, character
and loyalty, etc.—footed up 2,415 cases in all, the
grand total carried on the records as actual “cases” amounting
to 5,691.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice labors, as usual in all the
great cities, meant a vast amount of time and energy expended
on the part of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. men, with the usual percent
of win, lose, and draw—all offered in the infinite variety
afforded by the California climate. Some of the cases were
odd, some mysterious, and a good many of them big. Perhaps
a few from the many turned in by Frisco may be found
interesting, though chosen practically by chance. One of
these is a wireless case. It should not be dismissed as another
“mysterious signal” flivver until read quite through
to its close.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="nowrap">B——</span> and her mother had moved into a flat on
Williard street. The persons who occupied the flat before
them came back to get some plates and other material, which
looked so strange that Mrs. <span class="nowrap">B——</span> thought there had been
a wireless plant there, so she reported it. They refused to
give up the fixture material then in their possession. The
place was on a high hill overlooking the bay and would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
been an ideal locality for a wireless plant which might have
given information to the enemy.</p>

<p>Operative No. 440 took over this case. He found that the
house stood at the edge of a wood on a rocky hill. The two
women explained that the place had been occupied by a man
named <span class="nowrap">G——</span> who seemed very mysterious. He would
hang around the house all day and come home at different
hours. He moved away suddenly. He used to make trips
in the woods with people not known about there. Operative
found in the house several base plates for electric light plugs,
also electric wires grounded on the water and gas pipes,
and also a hole cut in the side of the house, as is done when
a high tension wire is passed through.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="nowrap">B——</span> stated that at night sounds similar to those
made by a wireless sending outfit often were heard, also that
a sound representing rapping signals occurred at the rear
of the house. The operative, making all allowances for a
woman’s nervousness, returned that evening. Sure enough,
he heard the sounds persistently as described. They did
come from the rear of the house, and, although examination
was made there at once and next day by daylight, he was
unable to tell what made the sounds.</p>

<p>The case now looked promising, so the operative again
went over the premises. He could not find any trace of
wireless apparatus. He did find a pipe starting at the edge
of the woods and tried to follow this. It led to the brink
of a high bluff. Just at the edge of the bluff the operative
almost stepped on a rattlesnake, and in attempting to escape
he rolled to the bottom of the bank, carrying the pipe with
him! When he came to, he was free of the snake. He looked
at his pipe, but found it clogged with dirt. It therefore
could not have been used lately as a wire conduit.</p>

<p>Nothing could be learned of the former occupant, <span class="nowrap">G——</span>,
except that he was a musician. Inquiry among musical
societies and unions finally located him as a player in a
place called the “Hoffbrau”—since very patriotically
changed to the “States Café.” Reports were that he had
been born in the city of New York and served honorably in
the United States Navy. His wife’s father had fought in
the Civil War. After <span class="nowrap">G——</span> had been found, the operative
had a talk with him. Soon thereafter, light was offered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
on a very mysterious situation. <span class="nowrap">G——</span> explained that he
had to move very quickly as his wife had rented a new
house without notifying him. When he moved he had forgotten
those base plates—which were intended only for
household use, percolators, etc. But when he went away the
dog was not taken. He had come back a number of times to
the old place trying to locate the dog. At last he had remembered
these base plates and tried to secure them, as he
had put them in himself. It looked like a clean bill of
health for <span class="nowrap">G——</span>; but how about the mysterious noises?</p>

<p>The operative once more secreted himself at the edge of
the woods at about ten o’clock that night and began to watch
the house. At eleven o’clock he again heard the mysterious
sounds at the rear of the house. He slipped up quietly and
there found the solution of his really wireless mystery. The
“signals” were made by the home-sick dog, which was trying
to locate its former owner! He would come to the house
in the night and scratch on the screen door, making sounds
like a wireless discharge. His tail knocking on the boards
made the rapping noise. When a strange person would open
the door he would disappear in the darkness of the woods,
so no cause for the sounds could be traced. So there you
were—a perfectly beautiful mystery! It is told in the report
in a very unagitated style, but really it is a pretty good
case of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. work.</p>

<p>All sorts and conditions of men were enlisted and carried
on the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. rolls; but did you ever hear of an anthropologist
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.? There was one at San Francisco. It was
reported that a man living in Alameda, a geologist and
mining engineer employed by an oil company, was fitting
out a launch to go to Mexico and purchase supplies. His
trip was alleged to be for the purpose of oil prospecting.
He appeared to tell a straight story, and said he had bought
surveying instruments and food and intended to clear duly.</p>

<p>Two days later another A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operative heard that this
man had left for Washington, stating that he must get some
passports, although he was known to have passports already.
As a third man from the San Francisco A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. office was
going on to Washington, these facts were given him and he
was asked to give the man the once-over in Washington.
He did this and found that the boat-owner was getting passports<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
to England. He found also that this person was associated
with Professor <span class="nowrap">M——</span>, who claimed to be looking
up oil conditions in this country and studying anthropology
on the side.</p>

<p>As this operative also was interested in anthropology, he
and Professor <span class="nowrap">M——</span> got on very well, although the San
Franciscan was not very much impressed by the learned
man’s fundamental knowledge in a scientific way. There
was nothing, however, to show that the professor was engaged
in any enemy activities. But the San Franciscan operative
gathered the notion that the visiting passport-seeker might
possibly be engaged in spreading German propaganda among
the many negroes about the city of Washington. He finally
discovered in his possession a lot of pictures of a very undesirable
sort, intended for German distribution among negro
troops in France, with the intention of creating dissatisfaction
among such troops. These pictures carried the legend,
“See what is happening to your wives and families while
you are in France.” Copies of these pictures were obtained.
The operative made the further discovery that Professor
M—— was in the employ of this pseudo-mining-engineer,
who now stood revealed as an active German propagandist.
It was also learned where this latter Kultur-spreader got his
pictures.</p>

<p>Arrangements were made with one of the professor’s
photographic subjects so that the operatives might listen in
on certain flashlight performances by night. To cut all that
unprintable sort of thing short, it may be said that the operatives,
while seated on the porch, heard and saw all they
liked of the German color-blindness.</p>

<p>The learned professor, however, having his suspicions
aroused by the fact that the door kept opening and would
not stay shut as it ought to have done, came to the door,
poked his head out and saw the operatives sitting on the
porch. One operative sat there with a camera in his lap
and a flash gun in his right hand, intending to make pictures
of the picture maker himself, so that evidence of the reprehensible
nature of his own pictures might be discovered. The
professor, however, sprang back into the room and presently
came out armed with a gun and a bayonet. The operatives
at once fell off the back of the porch. Lunging at the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
man, the professor missed; but he caught the second operative
with the bayonet in the wrist and ripped up his forearm.
The men closed in upon him and there was a warm
fight for quite a while. Details are not desirable and need
not be given. It is sufficient to say that the nature of the
photographs was disclosed and details turned in to the proper
quarters. The anthropological German professor later was
arrested and turned over to the Department of Justice.
At last accounts he was in jail at Washington awaiting trial.
Regarding his performance, it is only fair to say that his
anthropological tendencies seemed to run true to German
scientific form.</p>

<p class="center">
<i>The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in Sausalito</i>
</p>

<p>Not so far from San Francisco by way of the crow’s
flight is the Marin County Division of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. at Sausalito.
This division also had a case of mysterious light flashes—from
Belvidere Island. Signals came from several different
directions and several different sources, but no one could
ever be located as receiving them. Across the bay from
Belvidere is Angel Island, a large internment camp, and
in either direction lies a neighborhood which is very pro-German.
There might have been signals, but no one seemed
to be able to trace the code or get anything intelligible.
Investigation of this thing lasted for over a year, and
finally the division concluded it was the action of someone
trying to intimidate the residents of that vicinity. It was
not run down.</p>

<p>Located in the hills was an organization known as the
“German Tourists’ Club,” which had been incorporated in
Vienna, Austria. Prior to our entering the war it was visited
by many alien enemies and many German-Americans,
so that it was under constant surveillance of the Intelligence
services of the United States and also by the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. of
Marin County. Considerable information was furnished to
the authorities, and one alien enemy was interned. Another
alien enemy was apprehended who had $2,500 cash on his
person and was trying to get to South America, whence he
intended to return to Germany. The same club turned out
yet another man who, on a railroad train, was heard abusing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
this country. An A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. man heard him and asked a constable
to arrest him at once. He was taken to the county
jail, where his remarks were so abusive that the Department
of Justice immediately took him into custody for internment.</p>

<p>The hilly, wooded and mountainous character of Marin
County, bordering on the ocean, made it a favorite resort
for hikers, hunters, fishermen and the like, and it has many
locations which would afford excellent rendezvous. It kept
the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operatives busy in all their spare time walking
and driving through the country. On one such trip along
the sea shore, in a very remote place, a Navy torpedo was
found. It proved to be only a practice one, having no war
head, but it might have been worse.</p>

<p class="center">
<i>The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in Los Angeles</i>
</p>

<p>The sun-kissed Southwest handled its A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. work in a
wholly modern way, as perhaps some of the sidelights will
show. How quaint and curious some of these chuckle-making
anecdotes—and how grave some of the serious ones—will
seem fifty years from now, when California will be looking
back on another generation of her large and swift history!</p>

<p>The report from the city of Los Angeles is one entirely
consistent with the reputation of that busy community, and
as usual the totals ran large. Los Angeles handled 2,136
cases of alien enemy activity; 5,275 selective service investigations;
1,494 examinations for disloyalty and sedition; 289
cases of propaganda by word of mouth and 61 by means of
the printed page. There were 289 investigations of radicals
and pacifists, and 648 of all other natures, not mentioning
those which had to do with food hoarding, waste, etc., which
made a formidable total of themselves. There are not many
sections which report a wider or more interesting range of
experiences.</p>

<p>As in the case of practically all our cities, at the time the
war broke out, the Department of Justice for Los Angeles
was inadequately equipped with men, motor cars and data-chasers
to deal with the numerous alien enemies, German
sympathizers and non-patriotic citizens. Los Angeles
frankly says that this species of the human fauna seem to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
be peculiar to Southern California, and certainly the totals
of Los Angeles would indicate as much. The Chief says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Some of us regretted that we could not do more for the Government,
for the work of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. appealed very strongly
to us. When we saw the local Government situation, a number
of us at once offered to help. The outstanding feature of all
this work was the absolute cowardliness of the pro-German
individual. In all our cases I cannot recall one where anything
like courage was displayed on the part of the subject.
The moment they realized they were confronted by anything
like authority their fear and their efforts at self-protection
were, to say the least, extreme. Individuals were brought to
the attention of the various departments who did not understand
and cannot to this day realize how the intimation was
received. They did realize, however, that there was authority
back of us. In many cases, the Military Intelligence Department
called us to their assistance where information could
not be secured in any other way. We also were able to
help the Food Administration.</p>
</div>

<p>There is distinct food for thought in the closing remarks
of the all too modest Los Angeles chief, made before the
dissolution date of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. was announced:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In conclusion, I will say that a great deal of good could be
done by some form of permanent organization of the A. P. L,
or at least the retention of a nucleus for a continuation of
this work if it becomes necessary. From time to time certain
conditions are certain to occur in this country, brought about
either by war measures or discontent among a certain class,
which will require drastic handling. The American Protective
League can secure more valuable information and better assist
in bringing the attention of the authorities to such facts than
any other similar body of citizens in the country.</p>
</div>

<p>These are words of gold and show the heart of Los Angeles
to be certainly in the right place. It is a new and troubled
America that we have all got to face now, with or without an
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.</p>

<p>As to the odd and interesting stories noted by the Los
Angeles operatives, the latter as usual seem to take more
delight in telling of their fiascos than they do of their successes,
but saving grace was usually there. For instance a
woman and her husband living in Glendale were very rabid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
about the war, and hence received a visit. The informants
turned out to be church members and apparently desirable
citizens. The female suspected fell into hysterics, cursed the
Frenchman who lived next door and the Englishman who
lived several houses beyond, and declared she had bought
Liberty Bonds and had up flags enough to be left alone. The
German himself demanded to know by what authority he
was visited. The League man told him there was plenty
of authority all right, and that he did not need to specify.
The suspect took a good hint, and from that time neither the
man nor his wife was guilty of any public utterance of
any sort whatever on war matters.</p>

<p>One Herman F. <span class="nowrap">H——</span> claimed that he was a “secret
service man” and showed a badge and some handcuffs, but
still talked very pro-German. He said among other things
that the American people would wake up—that the Kaiser
would show them something—that we could not win the
war. His nearest friend was an army sergeant by the name
of Paul <span class="nowrap">S——</span> of Fort McArthur. These two would talk
together in German. The doughty <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> sergeant was also
of the belief that our army had no chance and said the
soldiers were all dissatisfied. They were both investigated.
The sergeant was put in jail at Los Angeles. Military Intelligence
took over the rest of the case—and M.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;D. has
never been noted for its mercifulness.</p>

<p>An over-zealous woman in one instance reported suspicious
activity on the part of a family which had a great many
mysterious packages delivered at their address. She said
they had quantities of large pipe which they would fill with
guns and ammunition, also boxes of rifle cartridges. Investigation
proved that some of the mysterious packages were
only lunch baskets; that the trucks were hauling large pieces
of well-casing and sometimes small articles of grocery or
hardware were slipped into the pipes to save space. They
had no packages of ammunition at all, and the packages
of cartridges were only pasteboard boxes containing shelled
walnuts. Jumpy times.</p>

<p>A man by the name of <span class="nowrap">M——</span> came from Chicago, and
closely following him came a report that he was wanted
by the Chicago police. Operatives located the man and
thought he would look well in the uniform of the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
States Army, but the recruiting office, inquiring into the
reason for the Chicago telegram, found that the man had
served a term in the penitentiary. He was not, therefore,
classified even as a slacker and he did not get into the Army,
which will not receive anyone who has served a prison
sentence.</p>

<p>Los Angeles had considerable to do with the stoppage
of propaganda by means of motion pictures, that city being
the capital of filmdom. Newspaper reports of the cases of
the film “Patria” and of “The Spirit of 1776” are familiar
to the reading public. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. was always on hand for
film censorship purposes.</p>

<p>A case which attracted considerable attention was known
as the von <span class="nowrap">H——</span> case. The subject was a native of Germany,
fifty-three years of age, a resident in the United
States for thirty-two years. He never had become a citizen,
although once employed in the California post office. Von
H—— was a movie actor who did spy parts. He fraternized
with the soldiers and sailors <i>in propria persona</i>, and
liked to ask them to his room for conversations over the war.
At length he was arrested. His rooms turned out a mass
of evidence, including four hundred snap shots and some
forty letters of the vilest nature. He had intended to send
this material over to Germany to show the lack of morale
of the American soldiers and sailors. He had an oil painting
of the Kaiser, a picture of von Hindenburg and one of
the German flag. He was sentenced to five years, but it is
not thought that he will live out his sentence. Perhaps we
can struggle along without him.</p>

<p>There is no character in whom the public more naturally
reposes confidence than in the tried and true negro Pullman
porter, but this is the story of one such porter accused of
draft evasion. He was confined in jail but was offered release
if he would go into the Army. He told the operative
that he would go all right, but that his check for forty dollars
was not on hand and that he needed about five dollars
to “float himself.” The operative loaned him the five dollars
and the Pullman porter is still floating. Neither Army
nor anyone else has heard of him since.</p>

<p>Most of the more groundless suspicions and imaginings of
Americans regarding German spies arose among the women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
of the country. Their apprehensions at times would lead
them to report almost anything. One small demure little
woman once applied to the headquarters of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in
Los Angeles and said that she knew parties—German spies—who
received money from Germany and who had no resources
other than the funds of the German Government.
The chief asked her upon what she based her information.
The little lady looked carefully around the room, under the
table and out of the window, and then came close up to the
chief before she gave him the real basis of her charge. She
said that the parties referred to were the possessors of a
cuckoo clock which she was sure was made in Germany;
hence they must be pro-Germans, and therefore spies!</p>

<p>The German ministers, it seems, infest the Pacific slope
as well as the northwestern part of the United States. Herewith
the case of Emile <span class="nowrap">K——</span>, minister of a German Methodist
church. An operative went into his church and took
his seat in the last pew. He reports:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A broad shouldered man in a frock coat sat down beside
me, introduced himself as Rev. <span class="nowrap">K——</span> and asked me if I
was one of the Liberty Bond salesmen. I denied any such
impeachment, saying this to him in German. This seemed to
please him very much, and Mr. <span class="nowrap">K——</span> thawed out. He told
me after a while that he was born in Wisconsin but that his
heart was in the right place, like most people that were born
there in “Little Germany.” He said he had been in Mexico,
where he had spent four years “very profitably.” He smiled
at me—rather meaningly, I thought. He wanted to know
how the Irish were behaving toward our people in New York.
He also said that it was too bad the Americans did not want
to fight. He thought that if the Japanese were to come over,
it might arouse our manhood. He asked me to be sure and
call again, as he enjoyed my company very much. There was
something cold-blooded about this man that made me think
he would look better in a German uniform than in a preacher’s
coat. What worries me about him—and I hope the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
will square it—is that I had to put a quarter in the collection
plate to keep up appearances. I demand that two bits back
if the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. ever puts him in the jug!</p>
</div>

<p>An operative was sent out to get a deserter who seemed
to be rather of an inventive turn of mind. He found his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
man in a barn, and when the suspect came out, the operative
ran up and called him by name. The suspect turned and
asked him if he was arrested. When the operative asked
him, “Arrested for what?” he replied, “You know, all
right.” He then admitted that he was a deserter from the
Navy at San Francisco. He wanted to go into the house
after some letter paper, but the operative would not let him.
Afterwards he said he wanted to go in to get a gun, and
would have shot the operative rather than go with him. Returned
to San Francisco from Los Angeles jail.</p>

<p>A carload of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. men went out to a deserted spot
in the San Fernando Valley near the Los Angeles aqueduct.
A mysterious German had been seen about, possibly with
evil intent. Operatives surrounded a small cabin which was
occupied by a very arrogant German and two women. The
man on the case reports: “I noticed a big revolver on the
dresser, secured it and put it in my pocket before we went
on with the investigation. We went through all his letters,
mostly in German, but discovered nothing in the way of evidence.
We told him why we had come and warned him to
keep away from the aqueduct. He took it all very submissively,
so I thought it would be all right to leave the revolver
which I had captured. When I took it out of my pocket to
look it over, I found that it was empty, the hammer had
been knocked off and it could not have been fired.” But
“you will note,” writes the operative with an exultant note,
“that I responded fully to the demands of the occasion in
the way of bravery!”</p>

<p>A case came down from Seattle to Los Angeles, having
to do with an itinerant slacker who came from Pennsylvania
and who, since then, had lived in Idaho, Washington,
and California. The suspect’s physical description was
that of a man six feet tall, weight about 220 pounds, health
apparently the best, appearance very shabby, an additional
circumstance being that he had a pronounced aversion to the
use of water which was very evident at close range. It was
stated that the man owned at least nine different properties,
and although indolent, was apparently well to do. He was
found in possession of Socialist literature, and declared that
he would not buy bonds or assist the Government or have
anything to do with the Red Cross. He was asked how he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
would like to join the Army. Since he did not like the proposition,
he was arrested for violation of the Selective Service
Act, found within the age, and indicted September 20, 1918,
by the Federal Grand Jury for failure to register for the
draft.</p>

<p>Los Angeles had a practicing physician who fled from
Germany to escape the rigors of its military laws. When
war broke out between this country and Germany, this suspect—for
he very soon became a suspect and was placed
under the espionage of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.—planned to turn a pretty
penny by the practice of sabotage, not upon property, but on
personnel. There were some cowards in this country of so
yellow a type that they were willing even to have their eye-sight
tampered with that they might escape the draft. This
monster in human guise assisted such depraved beings, sometimes
perhaps to the permanent loss of their eye-sight—they
took their own chances. This man got a sentence of ten
years in the penitentiary and a fine of $5,000. A woman
accomplice was sentenced to eleven years penal servitude.</p>

<p>A German, von <span class="nowrap">B——</span>, was a close friend of R. <span class="nowrap">B——</span>,
the two rooming together. The latter was with the National
Guard of California in the Mexican trouble, was mustered
out, but registered for the draft, being exempted on the
grounds of having a dependent wife and child. After he had
received his exemption, <span class="nowrap">B——</span> was told by von <span class="nowrap">B——</span> to
get into the Aviation Corps at San Diego, and that he would
show him how. The exempted man was admitted to the
Aviation Corps in the United States Army, went to Berkeley
for three months’ training, and then was transferred to San
Diego. He is a German and his wife is also. These two
men were reported to have made a great many mysterious
trips together. Subject was interned on presidential warrant,
it being obvious that neither he nor his room-mate
meant well towards the United States.</p>

<p>Can a leopard change his spots? The answer would appear
to be that he cannot—if he is a German leopard. For
instance, one William <span class="nowrap">S——</span>, a German small grocer in
Los Angeles, was doing a good business and living very well.
He had a son enlisted in the Aviation Corps of the United
States Army at the outbreak of the war. There was no
reason why he, himself, should not have remained loyal to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
this country, which had been kind to him. But although he
had been away from Germany for a score of years, he was
foolish enough to retain all the German spots. He said that
Wilson was a Kaiser and that the people ought to kill him;
and he uttered a good many additional sentiments of like
sort against this country and its Government. He was so
bitter in his pro-German attitude that he lost practically all
of his customers. As a result he began to worry, not only
for the Imperial German Government, but for himself. And
then one night he died—which closed the case for A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
and opened it for a Higher Court. Since it has been shown
in many instances that the River Jordan has not been able
to wash out the German spots, the query is whether the River
Styx is any more able to do so? That is the question in
which all admirers of German <i>Kultur</i> and its practices are
interested.</p>

<p class="center">
<i>The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in Santa Barbara</i>
</p>

<p>There is an unsettled rivalry between the two types of
beauty, blonde and brunette, which never will be concluded
so long as women live and men admire them. So also, one
supposes, time will not last long enough to determine which
is the more beautiful and lovable spot—Monterey in Northern
California, or Santa Barbara in the South. You can
start a riot over that question on any railway train on the
Pacific slope. One man will be ready to shoot anybody who
does not agree that the Seventeen Mile Drive out of Monterey
is the most beautiful region in all the world, bar none. It
is—it is! Who can deny it? But who, also, can deny
even at the point of a gun that the Santa Barbara coast is
also the most beautiful spot in all the world? Besides, the
latter community has scientific records as ground for the
assertion that Santa Barbara has the finest mean temperature
on the North American continent, and hence is the one ideal
dwelling spot for human beings. It is—it is!</p>

<p>But, very naturally, so fair a region as that of the California
slope must have attracted all sorts and conditions of
men, evil men as well as good, designing transients as well
as those calling California home. For this reason Santa
Barbara also had her organization of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span></p>

<p>One of the colony of wealthy men who had built palatial
homes in and around Santa Barbara was a certain millionaire
who had what might be called advanced ideas or free thinking
tendencies. Early in the year 1917, Mr. <span class="nowrap">H——</span> associated
himself actively with the pacifist movement. He had,
as a co-agitator, a reverend doctor who was pastor in a
church at Santa Barbara. They both printed pamphlets in
opposition to the war, and finally came out with a book
which was a very violent denunciation of war in general.
The two gentlemen divided the authorship of this book,
H—— doing the first part and <span class="nowrap">G——</span> the second. Reverend
G—— had the advantage of also being able to deliver
sermons from the pulpit. He denounced the United
States Government and referred to the American flag as a
“worthless rag.” After we had declared war with Germany
these men kept on with their activities, hence A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
took their cases under advisement with instructions from the
Los Angeles Department of Justice. There were hundreds
of operative reports turned in on these two men.</p>

<p>After a time another book, published by <span class="nowrap">H——</span>, came
out—a very violent arraignment of the Government for
its stand in the war, and very hot anti-draft literature. These
publications attracted to <span class="nowrap">H——</span> and <span class="nowrap">G——</span> a large
number of the weak-minded people who affiliated themselves
with the “Fellowship of Reconciliation”—a society which
ought to go strong in Berlin, now that the war is over.</p>

<p>Reverend <span class="nowrap">G——</span> was expelled as the pastor of his church,
following a very seditious letter which he wrote, saying that
he had relegated the American flag to the flames, expressing
sympathy with I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W., and opposition to the draft.
It has always been understood that the climate of California
attracted a great many people, and the state has always
seemed to be prolific of great differences of opinion among
those people, but when it comes to a minister of the gospel
uttering such things as these, it is going a little strong even
for the most free-thinking country in the world.</p>

<p>The <span class="nowrap">H——</span> case kept on attaining proportions, and
heavy shipments of literature were made into Santa Barbara
and distributed out of that city to various points. All of
these shipments were followed and full reports were made.
In the latter part of 1917, another reverend doctor, F.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
H——, and one C. H. <span class="nowrap">B——</span>, became active associates
with the foregoing. Pacifist meetings in Los Angeles were
raided, and all these parties managed to get themselves
arrested on a charge of disturbing the peace.</p>

<p>In April, 1918, a letter addressed to a man in Santa Barbara,
California, who had a name quite similar to the first
man above mentioned, fell into the hands of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L., because
the wrong recipient had opened it. It was found to be a letter
from the secretary of the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. organization at Los
Angeles, setting a definite date for a meeting at Los Angeles
where Mr. <span class="nowrap">H——</span> was to be present and address the assembled
multitude. The Chief of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. at Santa Barbara
notified D.&nbsp;J. in Los Angeles. At the same time, Santa
Barbara was requested to locate the new reverend, Mr.
F. <span class="nowrap">H——</span>, whose whereabouts now were unknown.</p>

<p>There now came into the case a Miss <span class="nowrap">E——</span>, a prominent
young woman who had been a canteen worker and Red
Cross nurse in France. Her family were friends of the
H—— family, but Miss <span class="nowrap">E——</span> was a friend of the
United States Army above all things. She learned that the
second reverend was at Modesto, California, and that Mr.
H—— would leave Santa Barbara on Sunday, April 7, for
Los Angeles; that he would stop at the Alexandria Hotel,
and would address the meeting on April 8.</p>

<p>This information was turned over to D.&nbsp;J. at Los Angeles.</p>

<p>It was decided to arrest all the foregoing alphabetical gentlemen.
About twenty members were assigned to the work
and these arrests were duly made at 9:00 P. M. on the night
of April 8. Certain residences of the above parties were
searched and an immense amount of literature and pamphlets
on pacifism and radical Socialism were discovered. Most
of the books were seized.</p>

<p>The first mentioned Mr. <span class="nowrap">H——</span> was hard to catch, the
deputy marshal being obliged to chase him through the
streets of Los Angeles for several blocks. <span class="nowrap">H——</span> had to
spend his night in the county jail. The next morning he
telephoned to his mother that he had “spent the night with
some friends of his, the Marshalls.” At least, he had a sense
of humor, because the only “Marshals” he knew were the
deputy United States marshals at that time, and he had indeed
been their guest temporarily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span></p>

<p>All the defendants, excepting two incidentally connected
with the case, were convicted of violation of the Espionage
Act. The wealthy pacifist millionaire was fined $27,000. The
vitriolic clergyman first mentioned, and his ally, the clergyman
of the second part, were fined $5,000 apiece. Two
lesser fines of $500 and $100 were imposed also. The
second reverend doctor was arrested on information furnished
by Santa Barbara A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. to the Los Angeles office.
Other persons of ultra-pacifist tendencies in Santa Barbara
have been kept constantly under surveillance. So it would
seem that in peaceful Santa Barbara all is not always peace—unless
it is the right sort of peace.</p>

<p>Santa Barbara made twenty-three arrests and secured fifteen
convictions. Fines were collected by the Government
through A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. investigations amounting to $37,100. Santa
Barbara had the usual percentage of flivver cases, especially
as to mysterious signal lights. One of these proved to be
nothing more dangerous than a night watchman on a railroad
track, signalling with his lantern. The operatives uncovered
one rather tragic case. A Franciscan monk wrote
to the draft board that his own brother claimed exemption
falsely, that he was living with another man’s wife, and had
been guilty of forgery. The couple were found making their
confession. They confessed further before the draft board
that they both were married but had separated from their
respective mates. They fell in love and began living together
within two weeks after they had met, and they had
lived together as man and wife for some time. The woman
was released; the man was inducted into the service and sent
to camp.</p>

<p>A Santa Barbara operative evinced a certain sleuthing
ability in a case which reached its climax when someone
blew up an old barn at the rear of the place belonging to
the complaining couple. There was a box containing a setting
hen, malignantly maternal over thirteen eggs. This box
was within six feet of the place where the explosion occurred—but
there was not a mark on the box, although the barn
door had been blown to bits. It seemed that something was
wrong. Matters simmered down to a spite case of a middle
aged couple against some neighbors, who finally had determined
to get their kind of justice by blowing up their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
barn—but they did not wish to blow up their valuable hen,
so they removed her before touching off the charge.</p>

<p>Santa Barbara County—not the town—reported 94
cases of disloyalty and sedition, 24 male alien activities and
20 female alien enemies, besides the 34 I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. cases. The
man does not live who can predict the end of all the vast
social problems which will have to be worked out eventually
on this beautiful Pacific slope.</p>

<p class="center">
<i>The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in San Diego</i>
</p>

<p>We have on our southern borders the Mexican situation,
not yet settled, but one day to be settled. Germany did all
she could to set Mexico on our heels, and her atrocious Zimmerman
note was one more instance of her venomous but
blundering diplomacy. Perhaps she wonders still how we
got that note when it first was despatched from Mexico;
and how we sat tight so long with knowledge of it in our
possession. This is by way of saying that the old Spanish
city of San Diego is an important naval base, located close
to the edge of the intriguing border of the Southwest—and
a borderland is always a zone of espionage.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, not surprising to say that San Diego had
65 cases of alien enemy activities and 842 cases of disloyalty
and sedition, 286 instances of propaganda and 32 I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.
cases. For the War Department, there were 554 investigations,
98 of these being character and loyalty investigations.
So that, on the whole, it may be seen that this once indolent
city of the Southwest, now a busy center of affairs, also
had an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. during the war.</p>

<p>There is a curious range of cases reported from one and
another corner of the country to the National Directors of
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. Sometimes an extraordinarily troublesome case has
had very little at bottom; and again a simple case often
turned out big. Yet again, a case might have all the ear-marks
of simplicity and prove full of trouble. For instance,
if you were sent to arrest a woman, you customarily would
not expect her to disclose herself to be a walking arsenal
of offensive weapons—a woman’s portative appliances,
lacking pockets as they do, not seeming to give her natural
facilities for heeling herself in any way practical for quick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
action. Such, however, proved to be a wrong estimate of a
certain young lady whom we may call Miss M. <span class="nowrap">E——</span>, reported
in connection with certain alleged “German activity.”
She certainly turned out to be active.</p>

<p>An operative found Miss M. <span class="nowrap">E——</span> living in a garage
about six feet square. The room was in much disorder, showing
trunks, boxes, tin cans and literature all about. Some
ammunition was found, which the operative left in place.
He did not open the trunk. Suspect was reported sometimes
around a print shop, which next was visited. The proprietor
said that the suspect sometimes did some printing herself in
his little shop. Neighbors seemed to be afraid of suspect,
and said she had been seen with a revolver in her coat
pocket.</p>

<p>Operative interviewed the suspect herself and asked her
how about the literature she had been printing. She admitted
she had distributed about one hundred copies of a circular.
We may at this point allow the operative to tell his
simple and uneventful story in his own words.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I then told her we had a search warrant, but she had
better come down to the Federal Agent. She refused, saying
she had work to do and must get it out. I told her we had a
car outside and would bring her back to her print shop, but
she still refused. I then told her I would walk down with
her to the print shop and then we could talk over the ’phone
and get more instructions. When we arrived at the print
shop, which is about eight feet square, I told Operative No. 9
to go into the house and call up Mr. <span class="nowrap">W——</span>, Federal Agent,
and ask for instructions. Being warned by the neighbors that
subject carried a gun, I went into the printing shop and asked
her if she did carry a gun. She immediately became enraged
and rushed for her leather grip and pulled out a .38-Colt, fully
loaded. I made a grab at her, and after a tussle obtained
possession of the weapon. While putting this gun in my
pocket, she obtained a hammer and was endeavoring to hit
me over the head, and also at the same time calling for
assistance. I now called Operative No. 9 from the house, and
between us, we obtained the hammer. But in some manner
she pulled from her clothes a .32-automatic revolver and then
endeavored to shoot us if possible. Operative No. 9 and myself
overpowered her and took this gun from her.</p>

<p>We proceeded to take subject to the car, which was about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
half a block away. She continually screamed, “Help! Help!
Won’t someone help a good Protestant?” We finally got her
in the car, and then I sent Operative No. 9 back after my hat,
her bag, and the search warrant, which we had dropped. I
stood outside the car, holding subject by one arm, when she
drew a knife from her bosom and slashed at my hand. I got
in the car and we tussled again, and I finally got the knife
away from her. I had just thrown the knife over into the
front seat of the automobile when she drew a small dirk
from her bosom. Between Operative No. 9, who had come
back, and myself, we got this dirk away from her, slightly
cutting her hand. We then thought it would be best to have
a witness as to what was going on, and seeing a man standing
looking at us, we called him. Upon noticing some women
standing at the corner watching us, I thought it would be
better to have them come and search her, and upon calling
them they came over. I told them what I wanted them to do
and they asked if it would be safe, and told them yes—by
this time. I explained who we were and what we were doing,
and asked them to search subject and they agreed to do so.
During their search they found a pocket containing ten bullets,
sewed on to her petticoat, an 8-inch Bowie knife, and also
another revolver, a Colt .41, fully loaded.</p>
</div>

<p>Nothing much further seemed to disturb the calm of the
scene, so the operators took the lady to the county jail,
where she was later turned over for examination to the Department
of Justice. The two operatives then went back to
the subject’s room and found in every conceivable place ammunition
of every description. It was sewed in the mattress,
stuffed in tin cans, concealed in her trunk. There
were also found a Winchester repeating rifle and a Remington
repeating rifle, and ammunition in all amounting to
about 1,000 rounds. When her hand-grip was searched at
the office, it was found to contain four tobacco pouches of
bullets, sixty-six in all, and a full clip of .32-caliber bullets.
In the garage where the lady lived, some bottles were found
and some cans containing powder, which were taken away
for analysis.</p>

<p>The District Attorney recognized in Miss M. <span class="nowrap">E——</span> a
woman who had been tried twice for insanity, having been
sent once to an asylum. She was committed to the State
Asylum at Patton, and the authorities there were notified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
that in case of her future release she should be kept under
surveillance. Thus endeth the first lesson, about Miss M.
E——. If she had had more money, probably she would
have bought more guns. A pleasant day’s work for men not
on anybody’s pay roll.</p>

<p>San Diego had another case which kept the local division
going for a time. Among its operatives was a crippled newsboy
who once belonged to the Army. This lad had both his
legs cut off in a railroad accident as he was changing from
one train to another, on his way to a new army post. To
make a livelihood, he took up a newsboy’s occupation and
became a familiar figure on the sidewalks. He had a board
to which he fastened a pair of roller skates, and by means
of a small block of wood he learned to push himself along
the sidewalks at a very good rate of speed. It came to
the attention of the division that this newsboy was a very
keen observer and it was known he had a knowledge of six
languages. He was enrolled and became very useful—indeed
he was at the bottom of one of the biggest and most
dangerous cases San Diego ever had; which shows that no
crippled soldiers ought ever to despair.</p>

<p>The crippled newsboy ate in a certain restaurant, and
there by chance he overheard a conversation between some
Mexicans. He got a mass of information and turned it into
the office, where a report was made to the Navy Department,
which later ferreted out a plot that was laid in Mexico.
With no more than this passing mention of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operative
who, like so many others, gets small glory beyond the
reward of his own conscience, some mention may be made
of this plot, which really involved the extensive machinations
of Germans in Mexico against the United States. It
ended in the capture by the United States vessels of the Hun
raider <i>Alexander Agassiz</i>.</p>

<p>A young woman owned the <i>Agassiz</i>, but had not been able
to make much money out of it, and so sold it to one Fritz
B——, once a German naval reservist and for a time chief
officer on a German ship interned at Santa Rosalia. At
another period in his career he had been interned at Angel
Island as an alien enemy. At any rate, he made his way
to Santa Rosalia, and thence to Matzatlan, where he got in
touch with the German Consul. <span class="nowrap">B——</span> was sent to Mexico<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
City for a conference with the German Ambassador there.
There were Germans from all parts of Mexico who appeared
at that meeting. When <span class="nowrap">B——</span> came back, he
sought out the acquaintance of the young woman who owned
the boat and induced her to sell it to him. The boat then
was hauled out and thoroughly overhauled by German sailors
who had arrived from the fleet of German ships at Santa
Rosalia. The hull was calked, new sails were bent on, the
machinery was overhauled, and in general the boat was made
ready for her career as a raider.</p>

<p>In the meantime <span class="nowrap">B——</span> obtained full armament and instruments
for his ship. He had some of his arms on an
island seven miles northwest of Matzatlan, but the rest of
the equipment was taken aboard the <i>Agassiz</i>. This was
carried on openly and the news got out to the American
Patrol Fleet. A cruiser put in an appearance off the mouth
of Matzatlan Harbor. Hence, instead of sailing out with
a crew of twenty Germans, only five Germans were put
aboard the <i>Agassiz</i>, with two American women and six Mexicans.
B—— figured that the boat would be taken as a
harmless trader and allowed to go out. He guessed wrong.
The <i>Agassiz</i> made a dash for the open sea. But by this
time wireless had brought up two other American warships.
They closed in on the incipient raider and signaled her to
heave to. Not being obeyed, they planted a shell in front
of the raider’s bow, which brought her up.</p>

<p>Before the naval men could get aboard the <i>Agassiz</i>, her
crew worked as hard as they could to throw overboard everything
of an incriminating nature. They also tried to wreck
the engine and destroy the bearings in the magneto. The
blue-jackets found some rifles and revolvers, some German
flags and a secret cipher. From the papers it was learned
that <span class="nowrap">B——</span> was in hiding at Venados Island. This was
on Mexican soil, so he could not be seized.</p>

<p>It was learned that the German Consul at Matzatlan had
forced all the crew to take the oath of allegiance to the
Kaiser. He had instructed <span class="nowrap">B——</span> to capture speedier
boats, and after raiding Pacific shipping to work the Southern
Pacific, thence to go by the west coast of Africa and
north on a dash for some German port, so that he might
send to Wilhelmstrasse—Germany’s Scotland Yard—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
package of papers entrusted to him by the Mexican German
ambassador.</p>

<p>Had this raider gotten into the open seas and taken captive
a faster and better equipped ship, it might have done a very
considerable damage to shipping, just as did the several
German raiders which for a time harrassed the Allied commerce.
That her career was stopped at the outset was due
to the keenness of a legless newsboy, anxious to do his bit
for the country whose uniform he once had worn. There is
enough, let us repeat, in this very story to give hope to every
crippled soldier coming back from France—for this, taken
in all its bearings, was about as important a piece of work
as this busy division had, and is one of the biggest of all
the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. cases.</p>

<p>The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. did not disband at the signing of the Armistice,
and it is well that it did not. San Diego, like many
another city, has had more than its share of bootlegging and
vice investigations to carry on, owing to the fact that the
growing feeling of license, which had developed since the
Armistice, had spread among our troops. Among those quartered
near San Diego, there were, of course, some not above
reproach, and the bootlegger was known here as elsewhere.
This pleasant and peaceful town in the sun-kissed South also
had its share of the German-born. It would take a Luther
Burbank, perhaps, to change them, and even Luther “would
need time.”</p>

<p>There was one man of great wealth naturalized in California
in 1898, who held a prominent position in San Diego
business life. He was known to have been in close touch
with all the famous Germans, and had a pretty good insight
into affairs American and Mexican. When we went into the
war, this suspect became distinctly pro-German and was one
of the most active propagandists along the border, apparently
entirely forgetful of the fact that he owed allegiance to the
United States. Being well acquainted with the German population
in Mexico, he and others are alleged to have aided in
the establishment of a wireless plant in Mexico, and to have
financed people who ought not to have been financed, in
view of their past records. It was charged against him by
fellow-citizens that he worked to some extent with German
money; that he was connected, at least indirectly, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
Hindu plot case, and that he knew more than he should
about the illicit shipment of arms in the <i>Annie Larson</i> steamship
case. In fact, he was charged rather openly with
having been interested in the German efforts to give aid to
the ship <i>Maverick</i> in the Pacific Ocean. The wireless plant
in Mexico was located and wrecked, which spoiled the attempts
of an enemy clique to establish wireless communication
between Mexico and German ships in Honolulu.</p>

<p>This same man was linked with the scheme of buying arms
in New York and shipping them via San Diego into Mexico.
British Military Intelligence also charged this man with
being head and front of the most complete pro-German
organization in that part of the world. He was charged
with delivering coal from San Diego to a German steamship.
The British Government and that of the United States
joined hands in following out this pro-German citizen of
America. He was traced to Europe and found to have
gone to Berlin instead of to Paris. He was alleged to be
guilty of fraudulent transactions at an Army post, and a
man connected with him in his operations has been convicted.
He succeeded in getting his son and son-in-law
exempted from the draft, and attempted to get his son a
commission in the Quartermaster Department. For months
United States agents from various departments have been
after this man, recording every move he made. Finally a
joint meeting of the several agents of the United States,
gathered in San Diego, decided that the time was ripe to
get out a search warrant and go through his place of business,
his safety deposit box, and his residence. Just then
there came a change in the personnel of D.&nbsp;J.—and after
this adjustment the Armistice ended it all! The investigation,
therefore, is not closed at this writing, and the Department
of Justice is still on the trail of this disloyal “American.”
He is one of a great many of his type claiming
citizenship in this country.</p>

<p>It would seem that after a native of Germany had passed
forty-two years in the United States, he would learn to
feel a certain pride and appreciation of the benefits he had
enjoyed here. That was not always the case—certainly it
was not true in the instance of the gentleman who is filed
away as Case No. 392. This worthy had abused the Allies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
in language too foul to print, and seemed to think that no
one in this country would resent anything he said. When
called down by a loyal citizen, he dared anybody to make
him stop talking. He said that England started the war
and had an agreement with Belgium whereby England could
go through Belgium in order to strike at Germany. He
said England sunk a great many boats and then blamed it on
the German submarines. He said that England sent one
hundred and fifty newspaper men here to write up stories
against the Germans; that he hoped the submarines would
blow up every damned American boat on the ocean, and sink
all the transports and ships carrying munitions; that the
men the Yankees had in France in March, 1918, did not
amount to anything; that the United States couldn’t make
him fight; that this —— —— Government was rotten to
the core. He made other remarks of like violent nature,
and his remarks against the President of the United States
were coupled with such language that swift hanging would
really have been about the only just punishment for him.
He was arrested and undertook to deny the remarks reported
against him. The jury found him guilty. He was
sent to prison for three years. He ought by all means to be
deported when he gets out of jail, and so ought any German
in this country who has been found at any time to be guilty
of any such talk. We do not need that sort of “citizens”
in America, and we are not going to have them here.</p>

<p>There was another case, No. 300, in peaceful San Diego,
in which the suspect seemed anxious to spread broadcast
every manner of pro-German propaganda. He had been a
naturalized citizen of this country for twenty years, and
through his position in one of the city banks, he had been
closely associated with many of San Diego’s leading business
men. Yet, still deep in his heart was that love for the
Fatherland which made him willing to fight this free country
where he claimed citizenship and where he had all the
benefits of our too weakly-lenient Government. It finally
dawned on the minds of some of the customers of the bank
that this man was not right. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. was called on to
investigate him and worked on the case for months. The
man was finally taken into custody, and the issue was joined
between the United States Government on the one hand and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
this suspect and his influential friends on the other. A long
trial was had and the jury disagreed. A second trial came
off and A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. had fifty witnesses ready to testify. The
result was a conviction and a sentence of four years at McNeill’s
Island. Truly, anyone reading the San Diego cases
must agree that that division did not lack in energy and
diligence.</p>

<p class="center">
<i>The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in Pasadena</i>
</p>

<p>Life is so idyllic in Pasadena—roses—oranges—that
sort of thing that you would not suspect that anything evil
could happen there, or that anyone ever could suspect anyone
else in those select surroundings. But Pasadena had
her A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L., and they were not in the least above suspecting
the right people once in a while, as a brief tale or so may
prove. In short, Pasadena had more than 100 cases of alien
enemy activities, 321 cases of disloyalty and sedition, of
which thirty-six were concerned with persons not citizens
of the United States. These totals show distinctly the
amount of investigation required of transients, for the War
Department cases, having to do with the Selective Service
Act, came to only 155 investigations.</p>

<p>The <span class="nowrap">B——</span> family of Pasadena were known as prominent
pacifists. They held some very pleasant pacifist meetings
in their houses until the Home Guards and the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
got after them. After that their meetings were neither so
pacifistic nor so pleasant. There was a professor of languages
at Throop College, who was always a German sympathizer
and who always was very outspoken for Germany.
He was reported a number of times to the Pasadena A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
Throop was made over into a military training school, and
that was about all for Professor <span class="nowrap">B——</span>. He did not last.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jack <span class="nowrap">C——</span>, a society woman of the Maryland Hotel,
was gay and liberal with officers and soldiers—would
even give them a drink without the formality of their removing
their uniforms. Reported to the authorities. No action
could be taken under the law at that time.</p>

<p>Miss Helen <span class="nowrap">F——</span> was a very ardent pacifist and a very
ardent Socialist as well, and a great friend of some of the
Socialists who write books and have a national reputation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
She was investigated by the Department of Justice at Pasadena,
and when she went east to New York last summer,
the Navy Intelligence had her under its watchful eye all the
time. Perhaps she does not know that.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="nowrap">H——</span> of Pasadena was arrested by Federal authorities,
it having been alleged that he “doctored” the eyes of
boys who were subject to the draft.</p>

<p>“Friends of Irish Freedom”—a branch of the Sinn Fein
organization—contributed to the defense of leaders of the
latter organization who were on trial in New York. Their
meetings were attended by two A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operatives who
reported to Department of Justice. Meetings discontinued.</p>

<p>M. <span class="nowrap">J——</span>, a prominent Russian, staying at a prominent
hotel with a prominent count and countess, was kept under
very prominent surveillance for some time and reported
daily to the Department of Justice.</p>

<p>Ben and Robert <span class="nowrap">L——</span> were not so prominent, but were
content with evading the draft, so it was charged. They
and their mother fled the country and went to San Salvador
in South America. Pasadena Division, A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L., greatly
assisted D.&nbsp;J. in Los Angeles in locating these parties. The
case was of international interest.</p>

<p>Then there was the case of Madam <span class="nowrap">P——</span>, reported to
be the wife of a Russian count who is now a citizen of Germany
and an officer in the German army. Subject arrived
in America by way of Scandinavia, by way of Germany.
She pronounced herself as frankly pro-German in a talk
with the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operative, who speaks very good German
and who claimed to be in sympathy with Germany. In public,
Madam is more guarded. She confided to the operative
that she is getting mail from her daughter in Munich through
the president of the Norwegian-American Steamship Line,
who arranged with the captain for the forwarding and receiving
of letters. The Department of Justice got all of this
as well, as did the Postmaster General in Washington.</p>

<p>In Pasadena you might run against a count or countess
or baroness almost any way you looked. There was the
Baroness <span class="nowrap">P——</span>, wife of a Philadelphia man, who spends
her winters in a Pasadena hotel. Very pro-German before
we went to war, but more quiet since then. She is watched
whenever she is in Pasadena. It’s getting so a lady can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
do hardly anything at all without those vulgar, dreadful
people knowing all about it!</p>

<p class="center">
<i>The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in Whittier</i>
</p>

<p>This division had thirty-three sedition cases, in spite of the
glorious climate of California. For instance, information
came that one Jack <span class="nowrap">H——</span> and his wife were pro-Germans.
They were running a fake jewelry business in Los Angeles.
An A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. investigation discovered that the gentleman had
two names; that he left the Pacific Coast in 1910 with
another gentleman and that they conducted a fur business
in New York, where they failed handsomely and went into
elegant bankruptcy. Suspect was alleged to have been convicted
of perjury and sentenced to two or three years in the
Federal prison at Atlanta, Georgia. It was developed further
that he was given a stay of execution under bond of
$10,000. The bond was forfeited and subject came to Los
Angeles, where he resided with his purported wife and did
business under the name of Jack <span class="nowrap">H——</span>. Upon said information,
duly secured, the gentleman with the alias was
arrested, returned to New York, and re-sentenced to three
years in the penitentiary. His wife is still trying to find
out where A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. learned all about these things. Tut, tut!
Cannot an honest jeweler be allowed to get away from his
past in the wilds of the Far West?</p>

<p>Whittier is reported to be a quiet Quaker community. It
has a population of approximately 25,000, being, in effect, a
suburb of Los Angeles. The local division had forty-three
men. Whittier always has boasted that it is a place where
crooks do not congregate. There are Whittier oil fields,
which are the second best on the Pacific slope, but there were
no I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.’s in this territory, and no pro-Germans of any
very outspoken sort, no depredations, but for the most part
calm, as becomes a Quaker capital.</p>

<i>The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in Orleans</i>
</p>

<p>Perhaps you do not know where Orleans, California, is
located? And perhaps you did not know that a branch of
the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. was located in Orleans? That, however, is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
case. There were just three members of the Orleans A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.,
and, since there were but three, why not break the more or
less inexorable rule about names and just give them in this
case? J. A. Hunter was Chief at Orleans; C. W. Baker was
Secretary; and P. L. Young was the third member.</p>

<p>The Chief reports:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In this small and isolated community, this seemed to be all
the organization necessary. These men were selected as the
best representatives of the community, and all subscribed to
the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. oath. The local headquarters are at Orleans, with
no further executive and office force necessary. Expenses
were nominal and were defrayed by individual members.
Orleans is an isolated point, 102 miles from a railroad, communication
with the outside being by auto stages. It was easy
to watch all travel through the district, and the few aliens,
only two, who were resident were easy to keep track of.
There is no telegraphic or telephone communication with the
outside, so all reports had to be made by mail. We looked
after the work necessary in our district, rendering such assistance
as we were able and were asked to do. We had no
trouble at any time with the local authorities.</p>

<p class="right">
[Signed] J. A. HUNTER, Chief.
</p>
</div>

<p>We may be content to close the story of California, ragged
and incomplete as it has been, with this report from a little
mountain community of California. It is what the author is
disposed to call incontestably the best report that has been
found in all the great Golden State, if not, indeed, in all the
United States.</p>

<p>Only three men, away out in the hills—but all of them
Americans and all of them ready to work for America—that
is why this League was great; because it had men such
as these ready to do its work, as best they could, in whatever
form it came to hand for the doing. One fancies that
in all the stories of the many different towns reported in
these pages, there will not be one better received by the great
brotherhood of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. than this one from Orleans, 102
miles from the nearest rails, with no telegraph and no telephone.
The author of this book hopes to see Orleans some
time. He believes it may be American.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>
THE STORY OF THE EAST</h3>

<p>In deplorably skeletonized fashion, we have offered a brief
story of the League’s growth, its purposes and its methods,
and the stories of some of its great centers. But how about
the country-wide achievements of the League, its field story?
How can it be told? It is matter of regret that in no possible
way can that ever be put within the compass of book
publication. The records of these millions of cases, as has
been said, runs into tons.</p>

<p>If you should visit the division offices, for instance, of
New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Chicago, or any
other large A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. center, you would see in each city a
room full of filing cabinets, with indexed drawers, carrying
in permanent form the story of the League’s work in that
given locality. Mass all these from the hundreds of cities
engaged in the work, and you would have a pile of filing
cabinets as high as a tall building. Go to the National Headquarters
and you would find more rooms full of cabinets,
covering the national work—an enormous total, painstaking,
exact, correct. Go over to the Military Intelligence and you
see more of the League’s work there. Go to the Department
of Justice and look at the vast accumulations there at hand
from the reports of this auxiliary.</p>

<p>Now, in imagination, pile all this uncomprehended assemblage
of records into the middle of some park or square and
have a glance at it in mass. In that mountain-pile of written
and printed material, thousands of brains have recorded
their soberest and most just conclusions, and have told why
they concluded thus or thus. Thousands of stenographers
have worked long days and nights on these tons of millions
of pages. Be sure, in this mass of a nation’s story in counter-espionage,
there is to be found, ticketed and tabulated, filed
and cross-indexed under name and number, as part of the
archives of the United States, the life and actions, the birth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
derivation, antecedents, convictions, assertions and beliefs of
practically every man and woman of German name in
America. But close to the foot of this mass of the archives,
lay down upon the ground a book, a volume of ordinary
size; let us say, this book now in your hand. How small it
seems! It is small. It is no more than a fraction, a mite.
It is not enough. Some man’s loyal, unpaid, patient labor
went into every one of these records.</p>

<p>There came, curiously, cumulatively, the feeling that this
was not merely a mass of quasi-public documents, but an
assemblage of the most valuable human documents ever collected
in America. This was massed proof, not of work, but
of patriotism. Then we did have, we do have, a country;
there <i>is</i> a real America? Yes, and let no man doubt it ever
again. It is a great and splendid country. These hundreds
of thousands of pages which have been read—and every
report sent in has been read—make the greatest reflex of
America it ever has been the privilege of any man to know.
Talk no more of a merely material America—it is not true.
The real America at least is a noble, a splendid, a patriotic
country, eager to do its share, determined to take its place.</p>

<p>The bewildering amount of material from all over the
United States made condensation and classification alike difficult.
It was therefore decided to separate the country into
four loosely divided sections, the North, the East, the West,
the South, and to throw into each division just so many
condensed reports, taken at random from the whole as might
be possible within the existing space limitations.</p>

<p>In the East and Northeast were located many or most of
the great munition works and embarkation points as well as
many centers of war work, manufacturing and shipping.
This meant one form of work for the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. In the great
middle section of the country—the semi-industrial, semi-agricultural
central and north-central states—the activities
of the League were slightly more varied. This cluster of
inland states we have grouped as North. The South is known
almost traditionally; and the West may arbitrarily be made
to cover the far lands to the Pacific Coast itself, the state
of California, with its great cities, alone being given subclassification
in another section of this volume. Into these
several hoppers the grist was thrown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span></p>

<p>Would you like a real history of the war, a story which
does convey a comprehensible picture? The simplest way is
the best way. Read the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> for January, 1919.
Does it give a great pen picture by some artist in words?
No. But it gives verbatim translations of bits of conversation
heard by a nurse in a hospital full of wounded Russian
soldiers; detached, disconnected comments, points of
view, records of personal experiences. That is great reporting—the
greatest reporting in the world. Had our more
famous correspondents kept away from the routine of the
alleged “front” and gone into the hospitals for a half million
personal statements of wounded men of every nation,
they would not have failed to show us the war. They would
have written a great story of the war—a real history of the
war. Now the astonishing thing about the record of the
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. is that its reports came in precisely that way. The
story of the League becomes a history of the country served
by the League.</p>

<p class="center">
NEW YORK
</p>

<p>Once in a while an operative landed a big case on a small
clue. A New York operative was sent out to look up one
R. R. <span class="nowrap">A——</span>, an employe of a shirtwaist factory, who was
alleged to have said that he knew how to beat the draft. The
same suspect was heard to say that he knew of four men,
the knowledge of whom would be worth $10,000 to the
United States. When interviewed by an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operative,
he denied most of the allegations made against him, but he
did give the name of an Austrian army officer named <span class="nowrap">L——</span>
who had plans of submarines and battleships of the United
States. This latter gentleman was followed, his baggage
searched, and the plans confiscated.</p>

<p>Chautauqua County, New York, includes the cities of
Jamestown and Dunkirk, each of which had an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
branch, the former being the first to organize, June 26, 1918.
The Chautauqua County division proper was organized as
late as October 28, 1919, an assistant chief being appointed
for Jamestown and for Dunkirk. The entire county covers
an area of about 1,000 square miles and has a population of
more than 100,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span></p>

<p>The League was of great service in rounding up delinquents
who failed to return questionnaires. Local Board No.
1 of the Jamestown District on November 20, 1918, had
ninety-eight delinquents. By December 10, the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. had
reduced that number to twenty-one, and since then fifteen
more have reported, leaving only six delinquents out of a
total registration of 2,135.</p>

<p>The community was carefully organized with regard to
each of the financial war drives. In the war stamps campaign
one <span class="nowrap">E——</span> was discovered selling stamps without
having been authorized to do so. Investigations showed
that he had been secretary of the local branch of the
German-American Alliance and was in constant association
with alien enemies. An associate of his, who may be called
R——, said that the German Club was pretty much run by
a man named <span class="nowrap">F——</span>, an Austrian enemy alien who belonged
to some lower order of German nobility but had moved
to Austria. He became an “Austrian” when the United
States declared war on Germany, but was willing to claim
citizenship in any country now that diplomatic relations
were severed with Austria, since he could speak several languages.
The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. found means to inspect the living
rooms of <span class="nowrap">F——</span>, discovering great quantities of German
papers and an Austrian flag. The remainder of the story,
told in the words of the Chief’s report, shows how a mighty
small fire sometimes can generate an enormous volume of
smoke:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We learned that <span class="nowrap">F——</span> had admitted himself to be
engaged in getting German subjects out of the United States
and into the German army. Operative on the case, <span class="nowrap">R——</span>,
was confidentially informed by him that six thousand men had
left this country the preceding month and were to be carried
by the large trans-Atlantic submarines. <span class="nowrap">F——</span> himself was
going to sail October 4.</p>

<p>The operative invented a German cousin whose wife was in
Germany, and told <span class="nowrap">L——</span> that this cousin was very eager to
get across. The cordial clubman instructed him to write a
letter to “Freiherr Hans von Ungelter,” former German Consul
in New York, and enclose it in another envelope, which
should be addressed to (name given), care of General Delivery,
New York. The addressee’s name, operative was informed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
changed week by week. Further, it was learned that
the system followed by <span class="nowrap">L——</span>’s New York friends was to
give men physical examinations, and if found fit, to furnish
free transportation through the channels mentioned above.
The sole requirements were loyalty to Germany and a sound
physique. Operative stated that he showed surprise when
L—— gave him this information, and said: “Then the
report that a German captain was seen in New York was
true?” <span class="nowrap">F——</span> replied: “Certainly, they stay there a week
at a time, taking in the theatres and waiting for their cargoes
to be delivered at various ports, where they pick them up on
their way to Germany.”</p>

<p>R—— furnished the name of the New York man for the
current week, and a good operative went to New York to confer
with the Special Agent of D.&nbsp;J. there and with the New
York Division A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. General Delivery was covered, but nothing
showed. A second week was tried with the same result.
Operative was then asked to arrange an interview with
F—— for his supposed cousin, but <span class="nowrap">F——</span>, according to
operative, refused to talk or to see this cousin.</p>

<p>R—— came back to us declaring that <span class="nowrap">F——</span> knew he
was being watched and suspected him, and might kill him.
Tension was high at local headquarters. Then we started
in to investigate <span class="nowrap">R——</span> who had been our informant right
along. We learned that his record was none too good, for he
had offered to procure releases for drafted men for amounts
ranging from $15 to $30 a head. We then traced <span class="nowrap">R——</span> back
to Buffalo and got this report: “Great talker and fine salesman,
but always away over his head.” In other words there
was no case and never had been one. By this time we had
almost forgotten <span class="nowrap">E——</span>, the thrift stamp man. We were
younger in detective work then than we were later.</p>
</div>

<p>A report comes from Jamestown, New York, regarding one
whom we will call Henry <span class="nowrap">D——</span>, described as follows:
“Known to many in this town as strongly pro-German; a
radical socialist; believed to be an anarchist; has been very
active going from one town to another. He left Jamestown
for Rockford, Illinois; he went thence to Chicago, thence to
Grand Rapids. From the latter city he came back to Jamestown.
He has now gone to New York. We understand he
is contemplating a trip to the old country. Has been very
secretive about his movements. Seems to spend a great
deal of money in travel, although he is only a workman; has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
boasted that he had strikes called in every shop to which he
was sent.” This man was put under surveillance by the
New York office of the American Protective League under
charge of being a dangerous alien enemy, and was properly
dealt with.</p>

<p>There were no instances of violence in Chautauqua County
arising out of the war situation. The community was at all
times right side up. Those who have sought to belittle or
impede any war activity were effectively stilled.</p>

<p>Schenectady, New York, organized its division on March 1,
1918, with one chief, two captains, four lieutenants, and
eighteen operatives. The division conducted sixty-seven investigations
for character and loyalty; forty-two under the
Espionage Act; twenty-six cases of propaganda, and fifteen
of draft evasion. The division was commended by the War
Department for showing a high standard of efficiency; also
by the Federal Reserve Bank at Albany. Schenectady has a
large foreign population, among whom may be found quite
a good proportion of radical Socialists. These people were
expected to make trouble when we went to war, especially
as two of the largest local industrial concerns, the General
Electric Company and the American Locomotive Company,
were engaged on munitions and other war work. There was
no overt act, however, but on the contrary, the people of the
city proved intensely patriotic, over-subscribing every loan.</p>

<p>Rochester, New York, reports routine work for its division,
but had a good many operatives ready for any emergency
that might arise. The record-cases do not represent the
amount of work actually done, but yield the following figures:
Character and loyalty reports, 190; selective service,
4; training camp activities, 2; liquor and vice, none; war
risk insurance, 1; sedition and disloyalty investigations, 25.
Rochester would seem to have been much more pacific—not
pacifistic—than at first would be expected.</p>

<p>Albany, New York, offers an instance of a phenomenon
more or less frequently recurrent during the war—namely,
the apprehensiveness of the feminine mind as regards mysterious
flashlights in the stilly night. The informant stated
that for some time she and her neighbors had been watching
flashes which came from a certain house at night and kept up
for a long time. She was very much excited. Two operatives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
visited the vicinity shortly after dark. A light did
appear which might have been that of a lantern. It would
dim and come on again. The informant stated that sometimes
the light would grow as bright as an automobile light,
and sometimes it would seem to be red. The next morning
the operatives found a farmer plowing near the suspicious
house. He admitted that he owned the house. He said he
and his wife were American born, of British grandparents.
The operatives asked him about the mysterious lights. Smilingly
he asked them to go through the house. It then was
clearly evident that the light they had seen came from a lamp
in the middle of a room. The mysterious intermittent
flashes were only due to persons passing between the lamp
and the window. The farmer also said he often worked
nights bundling up beets, carrots, radishes, etc., which he
had pulled during the afternoon and expected to take to early
market the next morning. He usually did this work just
outside the house on a bench. On inquiry as to what he
used, he showed a large carriage lantern with a reflector, in
the back of which was a piece of red glass. So the women
had been right after all. He would move this lantern from
one end of the bench to the other as he worked, and this made
the changes in the color of the light. The intermittent flashes
were due to his passing back and forth in front of it.</p>

<p>A big chemical poison scare was nipped in the bud by the
investigation of a German woman who was found putting up
capsules of a white powder in her house. Of course, nothing
less than poison for our soldiers and sailors could be predicted.
Investigation proved that though the woman was of
German descent, she was entirely loyal to this country. She
made a little extra money at home filling capsules for a drug
house in the city. These capsules contained bicarbonate of
soda, tartaric acid, etc., and the woman took a few of them
in the presence of the operatives to show that they were
harmless. Thus, another case proved to be a “dud.”</p>

<p>An alien enemy was wanted at Albany, reported by D.&nbsp;J.
to be traveling on a motor-cycle. It was known that he had
a girl not far away and called on her or wrote to her occasionally.
The mails in this case, as in many others, were
used for decoy purposes. A registered special delivery letter,
marked for personal delivery only, was mailed to him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
at the girl’s address, with the idea that she would give forwarding
directions to the messenger who delivered the letter.
The result was better than expected. When the messenger
arrived at the house, he saw a man just about to leave on a
motor-cycle, and thinking that this might be the man, he
hailed him and presented the letter. The suspect signed for
the letter and was at once arrested and turned over to the
Department of Justice.</p>

<p>Syracuse, New York, had a man at the head of its division
who, before he came an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. chief, had made four
hundred investigations, and since that time has directed one
hundred and fifty more. A very close liaison was maintained
with the Department of Justice and the local police
department.</p>

<p>Just as valuable as though it recorded some great crime
is the report from Hudson Falls, New York: “Our community
is made up of loyal, patriotic citizens, who responded
to each and every call to duty. We have been active in local,
state and national matters throughout the war.”</p>

<p class="center">
PENNSYLVANIA
</p>

<p>It is hard to tell what is going to become of all the military
fakes and pseudo-heroes now that the war is over. Take,
for instance, the case of one Captain Robert <span class="nowrap">H——</span>, ostensibly
in the United States Navy, who fancied Philadelphia
as his residence. This worthy captain was also known by
other names. Sometimes he wore a uniform of an ordinary
seaman with overseas service wound stripes, although he
never saw service abroad. He wrote to his wife that he had
been wounded and told her to hang out a service flag with a
silver star, which she dutifully did. The star had not hurt
Captain <span class="nowrap">H——</span>, so why not put it in the window? This
gentleman spoke of a great many flag-raisings and elaborated
on the seventy-two days he had spent in the trenches.
He told all about German atrocities, and quite often took up
collections for sick and wounded soldiers and sailors in the
name of this or that hospital. There never yet has been
found a hospital to which he has turned over a dollar. Naturally
a good organizer, this young officer invented a good
Navy of his own, the “Naval Home Defense,” and at one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>
time had enlisted one hundred and fifty-six members, including
one lady and her two young sons. The project came to
grief because of a generous order for some uniforms, costing
something like $1,000, which was placed with a local clothing
firm and had to be paid for. It is too bad, because the organization
also had a ladies’ auxiliary, his wife being president
thereof. This is only one of a very great number of cases of
imposters parading as officers of this or that country.</p>

<p>Bradford, Pennsylvania, is in the heart of the big oil
country, and it had its own troubles by reason of its necessarily
motley population. A very interesting report on local
conditions, submitted by the Chief of McKean County Division,
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At the outset we were confronted with a situation fast
becoming serious, as so many industrial claims had been
allowed by the district board. Only one or two young men of
social prominence had been inducted into the service, and
charges were frequently made that the Government did not
intend taking men of wealth or prominence and that it was
the laboring men who would have to do the fighting. The
Socialist element was quick to take advantage of this situation,
and men who left here for the service went away feeling
that they had been discriminated against.</p>

<p>We took up this situation with the Department of Justice,
who sent us a Special Agent. A contingent of boys leaving
for the front did some printing reflecting very seriously on
the methods of the draft board and scoring the local slackers.
They had planned to put a banner on their train with such
inscriptions as, “My father owns an oil well, but I didn’t
claim exemption”; “We have a garden in our back yard, but
I am not a farmer”; etc. We headed off this plan, but the
worst thing about it was that many of the names upon the
slacker list referred to were of men who had legitimate reasons
for exemption. At the same time, there were some men
named who clearly ought to have been inducted into the service.
To silence criticism, we had a district draft board man come
to Bradford, and with him we went over a lot of cases which
had caused trouble. As a result, many of these cases were
reclassified, and many men inducted into the service. This
caused an entire change of opinion here, and since then we
have had no trouble of that nature.</p>

<p>We had one exemption claimer, a young Jewish merchant,
who told a very pathetic story about dependents—among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
others, a blind father and an invalid brother. This young
Hebrew was of the belief that he could do so much more for
his country if left at home to take care of these unhappy
relatives of his. Investigation did not seem to bear out his
point of view. He was not, however, turned over to the
authorities for action in regard to his statements, as he was
wanted for the army more than for the courts; and yet, when
he was turned over to the medical men for examination, it
was found that he had something which he did not know he
had—serious heart trouble which actually exempted him!
There are some people you can’t beat any way of the game.</p>
</div>

<p>A Bradford pro-German, born in Germany but naturalized
before the war, has always been socialistic. Put under observation,
he was heard to say in the presence of many, at
a meeting in honor of a man who was going to join the
colors: “Here is your —— —— capitalistic system taking
the best men we have and leaving men like ——” His remarks
were resented and caused a row. Investigated and
reported to Department of Justice at Pittsburgh, this pro-German
was arrested and placed under indictment.</p>

<p>At one of the plants the loyal workingmen had fixed it
all up to paint a man a nice yellow color because he did not
subscribe to any Liberty loans. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operatives arrived
just in time to prevent the frescoing above mentioned. The
suspect himself was taken aside and argued with by the A. P.
L., with the result that he presently disclaimed his disloyal
remarks, said he was sorry, and wanted to buy some bonds
with the other boys.</p>

<p>The Chief goes on to say that Bradford operated under
cover as much as possible. A good many townsfolk, he
says, could not identify A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. at all, although there were
very few who did not know that there had been some sort
of checking up of pretty much the entire population in matters
of interest to the Government. This impression aided
in suppressing a great deal of radical and seditious talk, and
served as a warning to others not to begin that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Reading, Pennsylvania, reports 170 cases of alien enemy
activities, 226 cases of disloyal and seditious talk, 38 cases of
investigation of radical organizations, such as the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.
Among other interesting stories contained in the Reading
report is one which has to do with a professional labor agitator,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
a wrong telephone number and an alert A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operative.
A workman called up a man whom he supposed to be
his friend, and stated that there was going to be a strike
pretty soon at a certain factory. The recipient of the message
happened to be an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operator, who at once took
up the trail and located his man in the shop where he was
employed. Witnesses soon were found who proved that this
was the man who had started the strike agitation. He had
been there only two weeks. He had been in three other plants
where they were doing Government work and had made
trouble in each plant. He knew the percentage of Government
work in each factory where he had been employed. He
was sent to Philadelphia for full handling. It seemed that
he was trying to get in touch with an official of a Socialist
organization and pulled the wrong telephone number by mistake!
You could never tell in war times when you were
talking to an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. man.</p>

<p>Wilkesbarre, Pennsylvania, had sixty-six members enrolled.
Considerable character and loyalty investigation work was
done, and a great deal of seditious talk was stopped which
otherwise might have caused trouble. The Chief adds:
“The mere fact that such an organization as ours existed
and that we were working in secret had a wonderful moral
effect on the entire community. I regret exceedingly that
this organization has to be dissolved, and am of the opinion
that it will play an important part in the readjustment which
is now taking place.”</p>

<p>Meadville, Pennsylvania, had the usual routine work on
deserters, delinquents, etc., and fourteen operatives were kept
busy throughout the community. The Chief modestly says:
“We did everything we could for our country.”</p>

<p>Bristol, Pennsylvania, did not turn anything in to the
Federal courts, but weeded out a number of undesirable alien
enemies from the shipbuilding plants in that locality. The
League gave very material assistance to the State Constabulary
and Borough Police Officers in making investigations.</p>

<p class="center">
NEW JERSEY
</p>

<p>The Trenton, New Jersey, district was one of busy environments,
and it offers a number of three-star cases. Let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
us consider one Graboski, who had a friend, Grabinski, who
tipped off the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. that Graboski was not a carpenter,
but a chemist with a doctor’s degree from a foreign university.
This amiable masquerader was believed to have been
instrumental in blowing up the plant of the General Electric
Company at Schenectady, New York. In view of his information,
Grabinski was dealt with leniently, but Graboski was
followed to his boarding-place and was there found in bed
listening to the conversation of the occupants down stairs.
He was taken before the United States District Attorney as
a preliminary to his internment in a southern detention
camp.</p>

<p>Much more proper than contrary is the conduct of a German
bearing the homely name of Schmidt, living near
Trenton, New Jersey. Investigation was made on report
of a neighbor. By the time the operative called, Schmidt
had a service flag in his window. Many different subjects
were discussed, including music. Old man Schmidt had no
more investigations after he declared himself:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Yah, ve Chermans ist fond of musik. I like musik, und
mine vife, she like it to. I haf der old violin vot I brot mit

</div>

<p>Trenton, New Jersey, staged a draft raid with two hundred
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. men and a detachment from Philadelphia
under the leadership of the Assistant Chief of that city. At
the Trenton Fair there was a crowd of 75,000 people. The
raiders set out in fifty automobiles and broke up into small
parties. At four o’clock in the afternoon the dragnet went
to work, and no one was allowed to leave the grounds without
credentials. Even the fences were watched. All operatives,
whether from the Department of Justice or the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.,
worked with courtesy, and there was no more difficulty in
getting out of the grounds than there would be in getting into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
a theatre if provided with a ticket. Many of the men apprehended
were farmers from out of the way places and had
their wives and children with them. Those being evidently
not of the slacker variety were released with the understanding
that they report to their local boards. No one was delayed
unnecessarily. After this, all the side shows and
amusements were combed out, and several men were picked
up in this way. About 300 were apprehended and taken to
the armory, where their cases were passed on. Four deserters
from our Army were taken, and the British Military Police
apprehended a man, thought to be a pickpocket, who was
masquerading in a Canadian uniform. This raid was conducted
after the much criticised New York slacker drive,
and the contrast was commented upon by the local press.</p>

<p class="center">
CONNECTICUT.
</p>

<p>New Haven, Connecticut, might very well have been a
seat of trouble, but appears to have pursued the usually
even tenor of her way, sending her young men out in hundreds
to fight the country’s battles, and making very little
fuss about it. The division took part in five minor slacker
raids, in which the men gave satisfactory account of themselves,
working closely in touch with the Department of
Justice and the Military Intelligence, especially in the matter
of protection of the large munition factories against
sabotage. New Haven is one of the great American centers
for the making of firearms, and that there has been no
serious trouble there is a matter of congratulation. There
were 226 investigations made for the War Department, each
investigation necessitating interviews with at least three persons.
The organization at New Haven was quiet, even tempered,
and strictly efficient, a fine example in a state which
was very strong in its A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. organizations.</p>

<p>New London, Connecticut, besides routine activities, had
one case which involved the trailing of a count, a princess,
a Russian banker, a Greek candy manufacturer, and a prize-fighter,
besides a person described as a “male,” but who
proved to be a young lady in a well-known local family.
With these ingredients as preliminary, it might almost be
sufficient to tell any reader to write his own ticket—and indeed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
the case is not yet closed. It will probably turn out to
be one of American Bolshevism. The Chief says there is
enough in this for a good movie scenario. As much might
be said for another pro-German case in which the beautiful
and accomplished suspect was followed by D.&nbsp;J. men, who
installed a dictograph in her hotel apartments. This case
also had to do with a draft of $14,000 traced from Montreal
to a New York bank, through which British Secret Service
men discovered a paymaster of German spies in this country.
This woman met several Army and Navy officers in the
course of her travels along three-fourths of the Atlantic
Coast. It is most disappointing to have the Chief add:
“We are unable to disclose for publication any further
facts at this date.”</p>

<p>New London had a number of special investigations, some
of them interesting, others ludicrous. One of the latter was
Case No. 245, Subject “Mysterious Flashes.” A woman
residing on the shore reported mysterious flashlights, intermittent,
but long continued. She was sure of nothing less
than a German invasion. An operative was put on the case
and worked five hours one night. He found a mysterious
man walking up and down the beach. He had an electric
torch which he flashed here and there, muttering to himself
the while, and now and then putting something in his
pocket. Summoning all his nerve, the operative cried:
“Halt! Who goes there?” Inquiry proved that the man
was in sailor garb. When questioned as to the nature of
his mysterious actions, he replied: “I am catching nightcrawlers
for fishing. I want to get some eels for my breakfast.”</p>

<p>Mystic Village, Connecticut, furnished another scare of
the same variety. Near the village is a hill, known as Lantern
Hill since Colonial days, because it is a convenient
signal post. Stories got out about mysterious lights on
Lantern Hill. On one clear night the investigators saw what
seemed to be unmistakable signalling. The light was brilliant
and changed in color from green to red. State and
Naval authorities resolved to look into the matter, and it was
arranged that on a given night patrols of naval reservists
from the submarine base and detachments of the Home
Guard should surround the hill, while forces of the Guard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
were to patrol the shores of the sound to catch sight of any
answering signals from the sea. The patrols were duly set,
and, sure enough, the light began to show as brilliant and
mysterious as could be asked. It seemed to swing at an
altitude of about two hundred feet above the woods. It
occurred to one of the naval officers on watch that with the
aid of his powerful night glass and a convenient perpendicular
presented by the side of the barn, he might triangulate
the position of the light. He had not been at this very
long when he broke out into laughter and announced that
what they had taken to be a mysterious light was only a
star rendered abnormally brilliant by the refractive effect of
the damp night air. Its later disappearances were accounted
for by the later rise in altitude, when of course the light
would cease to be distinguishable from others of like altitude.
Taking it all in all, this about finished the cases of
the many mystic lights which were reported from time to
time.</p>

<p>Litchfield, Connecticut, up near the stern and rockbound
coast, offers a good example of sober-going loyalty. There
were only fifty-one cases of seditious talk and twenty of
propaganda, whereas the selective service regulation involved
734 cases.</p>

<p>Ansonia, Connecticut, was honored by the presence of a
Russian Soviet Society called the “Society Lunch,” which
had regular meetings and was organizing other societies in
nearby towns. Sometimes this society would get a speaker
from the outside, such as the editor of the <i>Russian Voice</i>,
published in New York. The city of Ansonia did not like
these things, inasmuch as they tended to promote anarchy
and foster revolution. The division had one of its operatives
among the membership, he having joined the society
for the purpose of reporting on its activities. What the
society did became henceforth a matter of interest not only
to its membership, but also to the local body of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
vigilantes.</p>

<p>The Chief of Norwalk, Connecticut, worked in close touch
with the police of his city and was on the lookout for the
various alien enemies reported from headquarters. He says:
“No alien enemy actually apprehended in my district. The
only way we can account for it is that they were afraid to
come here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span></p>

<p>Essex, Connecticut, says something which will meet general
agreement: “We firmly believe that the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. has
done an inestimable work in the protection of our country.
Every man in this division is glad of the opportunity afforded
to be enrolled as an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. member.”</p>

<p class="center">
MASSACHUSETTS
</p>

<p>Springfield, Mass., had only nineteen members in its
division. That we may know the nature of the League
membership as a whole, let us look at the qualifications of
these nineteen men. They included a lawyer, a physician,
a broker, a private secretary, a social service worker, an advertising
manager, a college president, a bank president, a
furniture buyer, a merchant, a superintendent of the Bradstreet
Company, a traveling salesman, a life insurance agent,
a masseur, a surgeon, a musician, a shipping foreman, a
bank teller and a high school teacher. The work of the
Springfield division had to do largely with character and
loyalty investigations, which ran all the way from nobody
at all to a bishop in the Episcopal Church. Some male and
female applicants for Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A., K. of C. and Red Cross
were found unfit “either because of immoralities or bad
habits.” Once in a while a case of disloyalty and sedition
came up which would cause a smile. An applicant for a
commission whose father was a Belgian and whose mother
was a German was investigated and was found to be a loyal
American. When questioned, he said he was for the United
States of America, but that “father would never forgive
mother for the invasion of Belgium.”</p>

<p>A more spectacular Springfield case hung on a letter sent
by the War Department to the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. reading as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Will you please have your agents investigate a man living
at 71 Catherine Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, known as
August <span class="nowrap">X——</span>, and report the result of their investigation
to me?</p>
</div>

<p>The final result of this investigation was that the subject
was interned, having been proved to have been a former soldier
in von Kluck’s army of invasion in 1914, who had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>
taken prisoner by the French, had escaped from France to
the United States and drifted to Springfield, where he got
employment in a machine shop. “I have always wondered,”
says the Chief, “from whom the War Department received
the first information regarding August <span class="nowrap">X——</span>, and wonder
if again we have a case of <i>cherchez la femme</i>.”</p>

<p class="center">
DELAWARE
</p>

<p>This state is not one of the largest in the Union, and its
report is not one of the largest in the world, but it foreshadows
a very satisfactory state of affairs, both past and
future.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Pennington was State Inspector for Delaware.
He worked by means of three county associates and a full
set of captains, one for each representative district of the
State. A great deal of routine work was handled, much of
which had to do with applications for commissions, overseas
service, etc., as well as a certain number of sedition and disloyalty
cases. Some Red Cross rumors were run down, and
at least one important investigation was made of a man who
was putting out machinery better adapted for mixing explosives
than for grinding alleged dental powder. These
machines were to be shipped to Switzerland to a point near
the German border. Some draft evaders, deserters and
slackers were rounded up duly. Many investigations were
made by the various chiefs and reported direct to Washington.
The State Inspector had almost daily requests from
the Department of Justice in Washington in the matter of
draft deserters.</p>

<p class="center">
RHODE ISLAND
</p>

<p>Providence, R. I., had a good active organization of 275
members, all loyal and hard-working Americans. They did
yeoman service in assisting the local branch of the Department
of Justice, whose offices were so crowded with work at
times that the help of the League was sorely needed.</p>

<p>The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in Wakefield, R. I., was small but busy, like
all the rest of that great little State. Much of the League’s
activity in this district had to do with covering the rough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>
and broken seashore, a region largely occupied by well-to-do
Germans. Some of these alien inhabitants were found to be
out-and-out disloyalists, over sixty such cases being investigated.</p>

<p class="center">
NEW HAMPSHIRE
</p>

<p>The lack of any extended reports from this state would
indicate an absence of many of the tortuous problems that
assailed her larger New England neighbors. Manchester,
N. H., reports that the local division coöperated with almost
every governmental activity in the State, including the
Department of Justice, draft boards, Red Cross, Four Minute
Men, and other branches too numerous to mention. We
may write almost identically the same comment for Maine
and Vermont.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>
THE STORY OF THE NORTH</h3>

<p>Nature has not put upon the face of the globe any region
more fit or more inviting for human occupancy than the
temperate zone of North America. The soil is fertile, producing
with fair tillage all the forms of food needful for
the full development of the human species. The climate is
precisely that which calls for sufficient human exertion in
the unescapable battle of life, but not enough to debar men
from a rich surplus of things beyond the mere living, which
in the tropics is all a man asks, or in the Arctics is all a man
may hope. Lastly, its natural transportation is easy and
abundant. The rugged, virile, enterprising and successful
population of that region is Nature’s offering to the problems
of the world’s future, and it is safe prophecy that in
this region of America always will be produced many of the
world’s greatest thinkers and greatest doers; because here,
surely, is a splendid human environment.</p>

<p>But man, like other species, is a product of two forces,
environment and heredity. What was the heredity of the
temperate zone? Of the best, the strongest, the most enterprising.
The Colonies, New England and the upper South,
sent their strongest sons west in the early days. Later, the
restless populations of Europe, of Irish, Teutonic and
Scandinavian stock, began to swarm into that favored region,
a good part of which, then known as our West, lay unoccupied.
The Civil War prevented what we might call the
Americanization of the Northwest, which attracted heavy
immigration of North-European stocks. But all the men
moving out along the forty-second parallel as a meridian
line of latitude were of strong, well selected human stock.
That was the original ancestry of what we might call our
“North.”</p>

<p>We rudely may group this region as that lying along the
Mississippi, the Missouri and their upper tributaries. Here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>
lies one of the great future countries, one of the anchoring
grounds of humanity. Beyond doubt it will eventually offer
support to a vast population. The great population-centers,
the great civilizations of the world, always have been along
the great river valleys.</p>

<p>In the North, then, we see a rich region, rich in soil, in
forests, in minerals. Consider what ore Minnesota and
Michigan, by means of natural transportation, have sent to
Ohio and Pennsylvania for manufacturing! Consider what
millions of feet of rich pine Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota
have given the world! And consider, if you can, the wealth
which has come out of the soil of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa,
Minnesota, the Dakotas and all the rest of what we call the
North! The earth has known nothing like it. Here was
won the great war of the world, in which Peace overthrew
Militarism, let us hope, for all time. Here grew the sinew
which America put into this war, and it is in great part
because of her rich river valleys that America to-day is the
hope of all the world in the day of peace.</p>

<p>Naturally, if we should consider all these things, consider
the persistence of racial types, consider the natural contest
of all these strong men for the wealth of a rich new region,
we could in advance predict that here in the North, there
would be presented bitter phases of that combat which the
enemy fought on this side of the Atlantic.</p>

<p class="center">
OHIO
</p>

<p>Typical among the thriving industrial cities of the Middle
West is Akron, Ohio, a city of 150,000 inhabitants, well
known for its prominence in the rubber industry and other
lines of manufactory of great use to the Government. The
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. division in such a city might naturally be expected
to have something to do. The Akron division began in the
brain of a somewhat solitary agent of the Department of
Justice, W. A. Garrigan, who was sent to Akron to serve
his country all alone, equipped with one perfectly good aegis
of the law, but not much else. There were men all about
who were more or less actively engaged in helping Germany—men
who were spreading Socialistic propaganda
hindering the draft; men failing to qualify, knocking the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
Liberty Loan, and doing everything else they ought not to do
and leaving undone the things they ought to do. Mr. Garrigan
found that the Government had not appropriated
money enough for his office rent, much less enough to employ
men to keep in touch with the Akron conditions. He
needed men. Then overnight the Akron division of the A.
P. L., beginning with two hundred men, sprang into existence,
as it did so magically and mysteriously all over America.
Mr. Elihu Harpham, manager of a local manufacturing concern,
took the position of Chief. He had able assistants,
and always these men worked in close touch with the Department
of Justice, even in its most delicate and dangerous
enterprises.</p>

<p>Akron, according to all reports, had an exceptionally large
number of draft slackers—men who had registered here
and disappeared before the numbers were drawn. It was
estimated at one time that 3,000 men had registered in Akron
and never been heard of again. It was indeed a Port of
Missing Men. Akron Division took this matter up, and in its
first year’s work rounded up 6,856 men. The word passed
among all the employees of Akron’s great factories that it
was not a good thing for a man to be around without his
draft card in his pocket. Many hundreds of men who were
delinquent came in voluntarily to their draft boards. Perhaps
the figures will tell the tale as well as words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span></p>

<p class="p2">In the comprehensive report submitted by the Akron
division, Chief Harpham says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We started out in a small way to assist the Akron office of
the Bureau of Investigation, but expanded rapidly and soon
had thoroughly equipped offices, complete card filing systems,
and a sufficient force to keep our records and carry on our
work in an efficient way. We now have a membership of
two hundred and eighty-three, enrolled from the ranks of representative
citizens who have given untiring efforts to the
work. I know of no single case that has not been handled to
the entire satisfaction of the Department of Justice, and without
any display of officiousness. It is very gratifying to those
who have performed service to receive these expressions of
appreciation. I shall never be able to convey to our members
the keen appreciation of their loyal support which has made
our success possible. It has been a pleasure for me to serve
as Chief and to know that we have been a part of the powerful
organization which has contributed so much toward the
winning of the war.</p>
</div>

<p>Of these men who did the work—and it is work to handle
nearly 12,000 cases—all were unpaid volunteers. Other
members of the business community contributed money, although
classified as inactive members. Such laborers in the
ranks must be content to go unsung and unhonored, although
they truly helped to win the war.</p>

<p>Columbus, Ohio, is another solid, steady-going town which
may be depended upon to do the sensible thing and the loyal
thing—albeit at times in rather violent fashion. A Lutheran
minister of Columbus was reported for pro-German
talk and was found to be of German parentage, although
himself American born. He acknowledged he had never
allowed an American flag in his church, and had never
uttered a prayer for this country or its army. An operative
told him to be careful about his praying for “our country,”
lest he should be understood as meaning Germany and not
the United States. The community forced him to leave his
charge—none too soon, for the sentiment toward him was
rapidly becoming dangerous.</p>

<p>A Columbus restaurant employed a German-looking cook
who seemed to have considerable money, and who acted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
rather suspiciously. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. traced his history, covering
two or three positions which he had held, and at length
called him in to headquarters for a general going over of
the third-degree sort. He was found to have acted as cook
in the army cantonments at Chillicothe, and was discovered
to be a German alien without permit or any papers allowing
him in this country. Among his papers there was found a
photograph of himself in the uniform of a lieutenant in the
German army, also his order for mobilization in the German
army in 1913. He is now interned.</p>

<p>That the Columbus division of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. was at all times
busily engaged in winning the war on this side is amply
proved by its report:</p>

<p class="p2">Toledo, Ohio, had 162 cases of disloyalty and sedition to
investigate, and 600 cases of word-of-mouth propaganda.
Many of the reports turned in by zealous operatives are
worth reprinting.</p>

<p>A slacker was brought into Toledo headquarters minus
his card, but he protested that he had registered. He declared
himself to be drunk, said that the registrar was drunk,
that it was funny they couldn’t find his card, but if they
would go to Detroit and find his friend Heine So-and-so—street
address unknown—Heine would tell them he had
registered. Not considered conclusive.</p>

<p>Another operative in Toledo fancied himself very much
in the rôle of Sherlock Holmes. In one case assigned him,
he was trailing a subject who turned and started toward
the operative. The latter stated in his report: “When I
noticed the subject coming toward me, I immediately jumped
over a hedge and hid behind some bushes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span></p>

<p>Toledo did some business in the slacker raids, having
examined some 2,000 men in one drive.</p>

<p>Youngstown, Ohio, reflects a very sensitive social condition
which existed during the war in every community which
owned a considerable foreign born population. The Chief
comments on this quite frankly:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A feature of our work was the demand, made by people
in all stations, that the Federal Government, of which we
were supposed to be a direct agency, should look after the
enforcement of laws concerning health, morals and even family
relations. A remarkable fact in connection with these investigations
was the utter inability of a certain class of German
origin to forget their German ties and to live up to their
oath of allegiance to America, which they took, many of them,
fifteen or twenty years ago. In one case it was frankly admitted
by the subject that he had never thought about Germany
going into a war with America when he applied for
naturalization papers. We have developed the fact that many
households in America have been, are and always will be
nothing but a part of Germany in our midst.</p>
</div>

<p>Youngstown turns in 157 cases of alien enemy activities,
and 459 of disloyalty and sedition. There were 213 cases of
anti-military activity and 674 cases of propaganda, not mentioning
183 cases of I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. and other radicalism. In the
report of this division, the Department of Justice work quite
overshadows the War Department activities, because there
are only 213 investigations under the Selective Service Act
and 67 for character and loyalty, although there were 141
investigations of desertions and absences without leave.</p>

<p>There was a certain man in the vicinity of Napoleon,
Ohio, who put up a really stubborn fight against Americanism.
The Chief of the division says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I got a telephone message that one hundred Germans, armed
with guns, were gathered in an alien enemy’s house and
wanted to fight. As county president of the League of American
Patriots, I called out five hundred members, and with
fifteen A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. members, we started for the place after nightfall.
We traveled the eighteen miles in cars, but as we were
approaching, the Germans saw our headlights and dispersed,
except for a few who didn’t get away. We got three men,
and found some ammunition and one gun in a wheat field.
We were shot at, but none of us were hurt, although the report<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span>
got noised about that we had fifteen killed. A carnival was
being held in a little town nearby, and when we got back at
2:00 A. M., the ladies were waiting with hot coffee and sandwiches
for us, so we didn’t call it a bad night’s work. We
nailed an American flag to the house of that enemy alien, and
it is still waving there. The next day the Department of
Justice was on hand. We traveled into three counties to get
a man who said that some Germans had guns and would use
them. It was said that these guns were to aid Germany in
case she could effect a landing in this country.</p>

<p>About seventy per cent of the inhabitants of Henry County
are of German descent, and many remained in sympathy with
Germany even after we went into the war. We could do little
with them. Our League of Patriots tried nineteen cases in
Henry County, relieved a bank cashier of his position, got a
State road superintendent dismissed and brought a good many
other pro-Germans out into the open. The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. assisted
in getting much of the evidence against the road superintendent,
who was heard to say: “If this country goes into
the war with Germany, one million Germans will rebel, and
I will be one of them.” Thus far, the million Germans seem
less disposed to rebel since the eleventh of last November.</p>
</div>

<p>Yellow Springs, Ohio, is another instance of simple, honest,
heel and toe hard work. The division assisted in all
the war activities, and helped out the Department of Justice
in divers instances in collecting testimony.</p>

<p>Wooster, Ohio, says: “Our principal activities had to do
with conscientious objectors. We tried to deal with these
people in accordance with the law, and also in accordance
with the regulations promulgated by the President. We had
some amusing cases with members of the Ammish church,
including their Bishop, who was accused of advising men
not to comply with the draft order. This man caused the
county boards a great deal of trouble. He would not come
in and talk with the military authorities, but the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
brought him in. You have to know these people to appreciate
the obstructions they will put around all draft matters.”</p>

<p>Coshocton, Ohio, had fifteen citizens who were suspected
of being disloyal, and thirty who talked too much. Members
worked when the thermometer was twenty below zero,
trying to catch parties who were tearing down and mutilating
Liberty Loan posters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span></p>

<p>A quite usual form of report comes from Washington
Courthouse, Ohio—and it is one of the best sorts of reports:
“Assisted in the sale of Liberty Bonds and Stamps to the
amount of $150,000; rounded up slackers, and did investigation
work for the Red Cross. We had much automobile
travel. In the eight hundred cases that we investigated,
our men traveled more than twenty-five thousand miles by
auto, half of this mileage being covered by one man.”</p>

<p class="center">
INDIANA
</p>

<p>Indianapolis, Indiana, attributes much of its success to the
care with which its membership was selected. All new members
were brought in by other members who were acquainted
with them, and were in a position to know of their loyalty.
The Chief says: “Our men conducted themselves with dignity,
tact and discretion, bearing in mind at all times that
they were representing the Government and the League. We
believe that much of our success in keeping down propaganda,
sabotage and other Hun depredations was due to the
secrecy which guarded the identity of our officers. Indianapolis
had a total of 209 cases of disloyalty and sedition.”</p>

<p>Indianapolis caught one deserter 1,200 miles from home.
He deserted from the Rainbow Division at the port of embarkation
and headed west. He was found, working under
an alias, in a camp forty miles from Casper, Wyoming.
This case was started within fifty feet of the Indianapolis
headquarters, through overhearing a chance conversation in
which a woman said that a friend of hers was corresponding
with a man she thought to be a deserter. The suspect at
first denied he was the man wanted, but finally confessed, and
was delivered to the proper authorities. The whole case was
finished inside of two hours, the order for the man’s arrest
going by wire to Casper from the Department of Justice.
Another man deserted from Camp Sherman, Ohio, and without
coming back home to Indianapolis, went to Hastings,
Michigan. Here, through a woman who passed as his wife,
he had gotten a novelty concession at the County Fair.
Indianapolis A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. got in touch with M.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;D. of Washington.
Everything was waiting for the gentleman on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span>
arrival at Hastings. He is again in the Army—or was at
the time of the Armistice.</p>

<p>Though wireless scares are most frequent on the seaboard,
almost every city can boast several of them. An Indianapolis
operative thought he had discovered certain wireless
antennae on the property of a family with a German name.
A pole was found fastened to the roof of a shed, wires being
used to connect it with the attic of the house. It was noticed
that the attic had close-drawn blinds, whence lights were
occasionally seen. The whole thing simmered down to an
outfit put up by some young men to practice telegraphy.</p>

<p>Indianapolis also became interested in a man who claimed
exemption on account of heart trouble. He weighed 225
pounds, and stood six feet and one-half inch, though he was
only twenty-five years old. It was arranged to have this
man examined by an out-of-town physician. This resulted
in his being brought before the medical board in Cleveland,
where he was found fit for military service. There was no
direct evidence that he had been taking any depressant for
his heart, although the facts were thought to point that
way. It was said that some doctors gave slackers medicine
to give them temporary “heart disease.”</p>

<p>Michigan City, Indiana, had a very busy A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. division
whose activities were sometimes curious. For instance, the
town boasts a somewhat well advertised mayor, Fred C.
Miller, who has made Michigan City famous as being the
proud possessor of the only alien mayor in the United States.
Miller openly violated the President’s proclamation barring
alien enemies from Washington, D. C. He was held until a
thorough investigation could be completed, and during this
investigation A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. furnished D.&nbsp;J. with a report showing
that twenty-one of the city officials and employees of Michigan
City also were alien enemies! It would seem that
America has not yet been discovered at the foot of Lake
Michigan. The loyal minority of the population, during the
mayoralty campaign, turned over information to A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. to
the effect that one hundred and forty-four alien enemies
had failed to comply with the President’s proclamation
obliging them to register. A number of these were placed
under bonds. Indeed, with the assistance of the League,
the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Marshal’s office registered a total of 2,200 male<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span>
and female alien enemies. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. developed the evidence on
which one Herman Kauffman was interned at Fort Oglethorpe.
This division also caused something over one hundred
and fifty draft evaders to be taken before the local
board as the result of a three months’ drive under cover,
which combed all the factories and railroad yards.</p>

<p>At Peru, Indiana, A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. worked in combination with
the “Loyal Citizens’ Vigilance Committee of Miami County,”
an earlier organization of loyalty lovers which embraced
about three thousand members of the hundred percent-loyal
class. Mr. F. D. Butler was chief, and Mr. W. F. Schrader,
head of the Vigilance Committee, assistant chief of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
The two organizations appear to have had amiable and
efficient relations. There is something in the character of
the Peru Vigilance Committee which seems to be reminiscent
of the old “Know Nothing” party which had existence
before the Civil War, and whose general platform was that
of America for Americans. Does this Indiana Vigilance
Committee, indeed, foreshadow a revival of some such political
movement at a later date? It seems to have retained
some of the tenets of the old Know Nothing party, which
also worked in absolute secrecy, and had its grips, pass words
and countersigns.</p>

<p>One may recall that it was an Indiana poet who wrote the
line, “The Booger man will get you if you don’t watch
out.” At least, between A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. and the Vigilantes, a good
and sufficient scare seems to have been thrown into the disloyal
element around Peru.</p>

<p>There is grit, shrewdness and loyalty all combined in the
report of the Chief of Rensselaer, Indiana, division. It is
too good to change and the cases cited are given in the Chief’s
own words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am also sending you a few sketches of our work; if you
can use them in the history of the League it will be appreciated.
I am very much interested in the history.</p>

<p><i>First Case</i>: There were numerous complaints and rumors
of pro-Germanism and disloyalty in Northern Jasper County.
Our operatives, got a great many affidavits against a certain
Lutheran minister, and an enemy alien named Herman <span class="nowrap">S——</span>,
who had been bragging that no one could make him register.
Accompanied by an operative, I took my car one Sunday and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span>
we went out to <span class="nowrap">S——</span>’s house and the following conversation
took place:</p>

<p>Q. Herman, why haven’t you registered as the law requires
you to?</p>

<p>A. Well, I supposed that my father had taken out his papers
and I did not need to register.</p>

<p>Q. Well, how did it come that your brother Paul registered;
he must have understood the law?</p>

<p>A. <span class="nowrap">S——</span> flushed up, but did not answer.</p>

<p>Q. Well, Herman, you had better come in to-morrow and
register.</p>

<p>A. But I have some oats that have to be harrowed, and I
can’t come in.</p>

<p>Q. Well, all right, if you would rather harrow your oats
and not register and spend the remainder of the time of the
war in a Federal prison, you harrow the oats.</p>

<p>He registered Monday.</p>

<p>On this same expedition we stopped to see the Lutheran
minister as private citizens, and told him that the people of
Jasper County wanted no more German preaching and no more
German teaching in the schools; also they would like to see
Old Glory floating from the mast-head. We told him also that
this was the last time that he would be notified. In about
three hours we returned that way and stopped again. Old
Glory was floating at the mast-head; the German school books
had disappeared, and there has been no more German teaching
nor preaching.</p>

<p><i>Second Case</i>: The Local Board gave the name of Harrison
L——, who had registered in Carrolton, Green County, Illinois,
but had not reported for physical examination at Rensselaer.
He was living with his parents nine miles south of
this city, and he should have reported to the Local Board of
Rensselaer for physical examination. I went out as a deputy
sheriff to find out the reason why. I first called at the post
office at McCoysburt, where they got their mail, and found that
he had received his card calling him for examination. I then
drove out to the farm and found the young man, and he
claimed that he had not received the card. I finally told him
that he would have to go with me. He replied that he would
have to see his father. We went out into the cornfield where
Mr. <span class="nowrap">L——</span> was picking corn, and when I told him my business,
he exploded. He called Mr. Wilson a Czar, and the
United States Government almost everything he could lay his
tongue to, and then I asked: “Mr. <span class="nowrap">L——</span>, what are you, a
German? About five more words of your talk and I will take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span>
you along, too.” He had no more to say of a violent nature,
but evidently felt very hostile.</p>

<p>I brought the boy in. He passed the physical examination
and was placed in Class I. I told him that probably he would
be called to entrain in June. I tried to get him to tell me
whether or not he would be here to entrain, and he said:
“Yes, sure, I have learned my lesson and will be in.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mr. <span class="nowrap">L——</span>, Sr., had been talking wildly
and saying that he would rather see his son dead than in the
Army of the United States. He also said that if anybody came
out to get his son and make him go over there and fight the
rich man’s battles, they would have to take him over his
dead body.</p>

<p>I finally got in touch with Mr. <span class="nowrap">P——</span>, whose son married
L——’s daughter. He went over to see <span class="nowrap">L——</span> and told
him that if the boy was not in by nine o’clock on the day of
entrainment, the officers would have to come after him.
L—— replied that if they did come out there, he had a
double-barreled shot-gun loaded with buck-shot and would let
the first man that stepped on the place have it.</p>

<p>Nine o’clock the next morning I took one of my operatives
and a good 30-30 rifle and went out there; drove in the gate
as fast as I could make it, and caught the old gentleman in
the barn.</p>

<p>L—— had mislaid his shot-gun, but his wife found it,
and was approaching him with it. After quite a tussle, we
convinced Mrs. <span class="nowrap">L——</span> that she had no use for a gun, and I
took it away from her.</p>

<p>In the meantime their loyal, patriotic son had started for
Monon, about six miles from the farm, to get some mower
repairs. I left my operative on the premises, and started after
young <span class="nowrap">L——</span> in the car. I found him about three miles
from the farm, jogging along with his thoughts dwelling on
the hardships of war. I stopped him and told him he would
have to go with me, and he said: “Well, what will I do with
the horse and buggy.” I replied that that was not worrying
me, that I wanted him. He tied the horse to the fence, and
I took him in the car and went back to the farm. I told him
that if he would go like a man, I would give him five minutes
to change his clothes and get in the car and go with me
to entrain.</p>

<p>He was ready in three minutes and thirty-five seconds. I
took him to Fort Benjamin Harrison and turned him over to
the Provost Marshal. This man was inducted into the Army,
and has been in France shooting Huns.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span></p>

<p>These cases do not exhaust the files of Rensselaer. There
are more of the same sort, but these give a good idea of the
sort of problems which tested the courage, ability and resourcefulness
of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operatives and chiefs throughout
the war.</p>

<p>Elkhart, Indiana, is present or accounted for in almost
every branch of the service. The Chief says: “We found
most of our cases pro-German, with some spite work. Elkhart
Division handled a total of 600 cases of all sorts, of
which 117 were concerned with alien enemy activities. A
number of reports were investigated which charged certain
German sympathizers with offering up prayers in church for
the Kaiser and the success of the German arms. There
would seem to be no use in praying for the Kaiser now.”</p>

<p>One of the most American parts of Indiana is good old
Brown County, long famous because there is no railroad
within its confines. The Chief reports: “This has been
a quiet sector. Our people are native stock, absolutely loyal
and patriotic. A few late-comers of German origin began
to talk too much, but when they found they were being
watched, they stopped. It is good to live in an old-fashioned
American community such as we usually read about
in books.”</p>

<p class="center">
MICHIGAN
</p>

<p>Perhaps not many people in the United States have heard
of Midland, Michigan—it is one of the many new names
on the war map. But the Midland report—in many ways
the best report turned in by any A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. chief in the entire
country—bulked large and was very thorough indeed; in
short, it was a day-by-day record and report of activities in
a town engaged in making deadly gases and other chemicals
for use in the war. Midland is the site of the Dow Chemical
Company’s chief plant, a concern which manufactured acetone
for airplane dope, mustard gas, T.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;T. and a number
of other special products for the Government. As a consequence
it seems to have been a magnet for alien enemy workmen
and American laborers with pro-German sympathies.
Something broke loose almost every day; on some days, two,
three or even four cases came up. Altogether the Midland
report is an extraordinary document—indeed the most veritable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span>
and illuminating day-to-day record of all which the
League has produced. This blotter form of report supplies
a remarkable narrative of the chances and near-casualties
which the presence of a munitions plant brought to a normal
American community. It is too bad such a report cannot
be given in full, but it runs to 12,000 words, spans ten months
of time and covers one hundred and fifty-seven cases of
investigation. This splendid report came out of a wholly
unexpected quarter. We hear much of the romance of big
business. Perhaps when the reader shall have discovered
how many men were waiting day-by-day to wreck and ruin
one big business, it will not always seem to have been so
romantic after all. We may make at least a brief resumé
of things which happened in and around Midland. Names
cannot be given, but it may be stated in advance that practically
every case investigated was that of a man who had a
German, Russian or European name.</p>

<p>Carl <span class="nowrap">L——</span> was a German Lutheran minister at Midland,
and seems to have been much like his brethren of the
cloth in that denomination. He remarked to a friend,
“Why, you do not seem to realize that Germany will soon
control the world.” When the Lusitania was sunk, he said,
“The people who went on that ship should have been blown
sky-high.” Preacher <span class="nowrap">L——</span> is still preaching at Midland.</p>

<p>Alex <span class="nowrap">B——</span> is a retired citizen of Midland. He was
born in Germany, came to this country penniless, yet acquired
sufficient wealth upon which to retire. This country is full
of Germans of similar description, who have remained just
as German as they ever were. This was the case of Mr.
B——. In discussing the war, he said, “You can’t get
your troops over there because our submarines will sink
them.” By “your” he meant American troops, and by
“our” he meant German submarines. He was of the
belief that the German was a far superior race to ours.
Natürlich! Gewiss! Das versteht sich!</p>

<p>S. F. <span class="nowrap">S——</span>, another employe, was found taking pictures
of one of the buildings devoted to the making of sulphuric
acid, including the railroad approaches. United
States asked him please not to take any more such pictures.</p>

<p>A can containing a pint of giant powder was found in a
car of coal which was being hoisted into the boilers at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span>
power house of the Dow Chemical Company. Two Germans,
J. O. <span class="nowrap">M——</span> and Carl <span class="nowrap">S——</span>, were heard talking of
prospective trouble at the Dow Company. The former said,
“I have a bottle planted near the gate that they will hear
from.” Both men were watched, and their plot seems to
have been aborted.</p>

<p>John <span class="nowrap">S——</span> once claimed he was German, then claimed
he was Russian. He could not speak nor write Russian,
but was familiar with the German language and associated
only with Germans of the hostile type. He attended the
German-Lutheran church and was very insolent toward
Americans. Whether German or Russian, he was discharged
by the Dow Chemical Company. He found his solace in
conversation at the German store, run by two Germans, all
enjoying themselves very much, conversing and settling the
war.</p>

<p>Ernest <span class="nowrap">W——</span>, reported as an alien enemy in the pay of
the German Government, a sailor on the Great Lakes in the
summer time. Reported to the steamship company of Cleveland
which used to employ him.</p>

<p>C. <span class="nowrap">B——</span> works for the Dow Chemical Company. Operative
reports he said United States was to blame for the
war and that Germany had told the people of the United
States not to board English ships. All of which sounds
familiar—if not convincing—to an American. Ja wohl!</p>

<p>John <span class="nowrap">W——</span>, reported pro-German, had expressed himself
as opposed to the United States in the war. Since we
declared war, has been more discreet. A common case.</p>

<p>H. <span class="nowrap">S——</span>, in the army cantonment, but reported to have
stated he would desert as quickly as he got to France. His
officers duly notified.</p>

<p>E. L. <span class="nowrap">K——</span>, a foreman in the wood shop of the Dow
Chemical Company, reported to be willing to bet $100 that
the United States would never whip Germany. Too bad
someone did not take him up several times! Ach! das thut
uns leid!</p>

<p>A. B. <span class="nowrap">B——</span>, reported by some patent attorneys to have
appeared at their office desiring the Russian patent for a
dinner pail which would be capable of containing several
sticks of dynamite hidden in coils. A compartment for a
clock was also called for. This would be a fine thing for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span>
workman to take into a building such as this Government
enterprise. The attorneys did not care for confidential relations
with such a client. Close watch was kept for three
weeks, but the client did not come back.</p>

<p>John <span class="nowrap">G——</span> said when the Lusitania was sunk, “What
in hell were the —— —— on that boat for, anyway—were
they not warned to keep off?” Which again sounds
familiar. Indeed, that was the attitude of practically every
German or pro-German in America, no matter whether naturalized
or not.</p>

<p>Alma, Michigan, is a pleasant and quiet city, but you can’t
tell where a big story will break. Drama is no respecter of
geography. Which is by way of saying that one Herman
R—— is reported by Gratiot County Division to have been
raised on a farm in this locality. During the war he went
to Spokane, Washington, and joined the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. He was
indicted among others in the Haywood trial and disappeared
while waiting for trial. Gratiot County Division was
directed to look him up.</p>

<p>A visit was made to the sister of <span class="nowrap">R——</span>, who herself
appeared as much an I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. as need be. Through persistence,
however, they learned where Herman was approximately.
It was concluded that the brother and sister might
correspond, so the mails were watched. Sure enough, on
the third day there came a letter from Spokane addressed
to another sister, and bearing the Spokane postmark. Then
a brother of Herman was visited, and from him and from his
unmarried sister a snapshot was obtained of Herman and
his pal, each holding an I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. paper facing toward the
camera, which sufficiently well identified them and their
tendencies.</p>

<p>Later on both Herman and his pal were located, apprehended,
tried, convicted, and sentenced in the Chicago trial.</p>

<p>Ottawa County, Michigan, has in its population a large
percentage of people of Dutch descent. There are also many
immigrants from Holland, some naturalized, others not.
Most of these people have an inborn hatred for England,
which was mistakenly called pro-Germanism. A correct understanding
of the psychology of these people was no easy matter
to arrive at, but the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. handled most of them in
such a way as to convert them into patriots rather than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span>
malcontents. The Chief adds, however: “It should not be
gathered from this that our population as a whole was not
heart and soul for America. We rarely met anything vicious
in the way of disloyalty. Hollanders are ultra-Calvinistic,
unemotional and not easily stirred to enthusiasm, and it was
sometimes difficult to reach their hearts with feelings of
patriotism and love for the land of their adoption.”</p>

<p>Washtenaw County, Michigan, had the reputation of being
the worst pro-German community in the Eastern Division of
Michigan. Fully four percent of the people were pro-German.
Large districts are nothing but old German settlements,
“infested with that worst brand of citizen—the second
or third generation German.” The Chief instituted a
series of Star Chamber courts which put a wet blanket on
this gentry and changed Washtenaw County into one of the
quietest communities in the State. The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. men were
not known to one another, but they were in all strata of
society. They uncovered several rampant cases of Bolshevism
and conducted a good many character and loyalty investigations.
They investigated also 144 alien enemies who
applied for naturalization. The total number of alien
enemies investigated ran above 700, so it may be seen that
this organization was kept pretty busy.</p>

<p>Ludington, Michigan, looked into fifty cases of disloyalty
and sedition, and investigated six hundred cases of oral
propaganda. The Chief says: “We investigated about two
thousand cases; delivered upwards of two hundred speeches
for the Red Cross; nullified three strikes of workmen—one
on the railroad, and the other two in plants doing government
work. Over seven hundred men were involved.” Ludington
also reports the case of a German reservist who was
traced from this point to France, from there to Winnipeg,
thence to Seattle, thence to Chicago. The suspect was finally
apprehended in Chicago and interned. Real sleuthing!</p>

<p>Benton Harbor, Michigan, is adjacent to strongly German
neighborhoods. There were 1,000 men who signed up for
League work, each man contributing one dollar to the common
fund. The county was split up into five districts, each
manned by a lieutenant and several operatives under him.
A general secrecy obtained as to the membership, and the
division was very active and efficient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span></p>

<p>Grand Rapids, Michigan, was a busy center of activity,
and one of the best-handled divisions in the United States,
3,907 cases being investigated, exclusive of about 500 minor
cases in regard to German language, Liberty Loan, War
Savings Stamps and other miscellaneous cases. Of the grand
total, 2,357 cases were investigated under the “work or
fight” order. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. at Grand Rapids had a busy season,
and did its work well. It deserves as many pages as it is
given lines.</p>

<p>Iron River, Michigan, had the usual routine. One case,
slightly unusual, had to do with one Victor <span class="nowrap">F——</span>, a
Swede fifty-eight years old, naturalized in America. He reluctantly
admitted a pro-German tendency, but as he had
a large family, the local chief was disposed to leniency.
The Chief says: “I had previously learned that this man,
with his family, was worth about $8,000. I had him agree
to purchase $2,000 worth of Liberty Bonds at once and
to leave them in the custody of the local bank until the end
of the war. He also contributed $300 to the local war
chest, and agreed to aid soliciting committees among his
neighbors. He has kept his promise in these respects, and has
kept silent about the war.”</p>

<p>Manistee, Michigan, is in one of the most pro-German
counties of the State. A number of German agents had a
sort of representative at Manistee. There were seventy-eight
residents who swore fealty to Germany, although only
twenty-one of these remained loyal during the closing days
of the war. Not infrequently times became a trifle heated
at Manistee. German sympathizers once shot at the Chief
of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L., who had just apprehended several German
suspects who were accused of making blue-prints of pumps
going into United States battleships. The organization was
active throughout the war, and was on its toes at all times.</p>

<p>Mount Clemens, Michigan, is in Macomb County, a large
proportion of whose inhabitants are of German origin. A
flying field is located near Mount Clemens. Hence a special
officer of the Department of Justice was in charge. Most of
the work had to do with pro-Germanism, ninety-seven of such
cases being investigated. There were seven cases of alien
enemy activities, two of sabotage, fifty-six connected with
selective service matters, thirty of character and loyalty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span>
and seven of food-hoarding. No grass grew under the feet
of this division.</p>

<p class="center">
ILLINOIS
</p>

<p>There ought to be at least one good stiff report from some
town located near a big Army cantonment. Rockford, Illinois,
entry point for Camp Grant, has submitted a report
which meets every specification. It must be understood that
from 30,000 to 75,000 troops came under the jurisdiction of
Rockford Division each couple of months or so throughout
the war. Rockford is a great manufacturing point and
for some time has been a center of I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. activities, a
considerable number of I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. clan being found among
the laboring classes there. The League watched these people
very closely, secured stenographic reports of their club
speeches, etc., and thus got some strong Government evidence.</p>

<p>After war was declared, these agitators became very violent,
and carried on an active campaign against the Selective
Service Act. On one occasion they conducted an all-day
meeting and picnic at Black Hawk Park, which was nothing
but an organization meeting so timed as to interfere with
the draft registration. We locked up three men, at which
the other members of the two local unions thronged the
streets to the jail and demanded the release of the men. We
put an additional one hundred and thirty-five members of the
I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. in jail, and standing room only was available.
Special interurban cars were chartered, eighty persons being
removed to adjacent counties. The jail was pretty badly
wrecked. The leader of these men got two years imprisonment,
it being proved also that he was an alien and subject
to deportation. The Immigration Bureau has secured a warrant
for his deportation, and he will go abroad permanently
at the expiration of his sentence. Federal Judge Landis
sentenced one hundred and eleven of these men to one year
in the Bridewell at Chicago. This case has been referred
to in the report of Mr. Colby, D.&nbsp;J. agent at Chicago, as one
of the most important in the Western country. A special
agent was sent out by the Department of Justice to Rockford,
with the result that an office was established there to
carry on the joint work more efficiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</span></p>

<p>After Camp Grant was located at Rockford, the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
had much more work to do. While the buildings were going
up, about 50,000 men passed through the employment bureau,
from 7,000 to 10,000 being employed in the work. All classes
of men were attracted to Rockford, and the local division
was busy in keeping watch over them. Thirty-five I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.
members were taken from the camp laborers and handled in
different ways—always with encouragement to go away
and stay away. Two alien enemies were found among the
laboring men at Rockford. They had come to America surreptitiously
after the war began in Europe and had worked
at various cantonments. They finally admitted they were
German subjects, and were interned for the war. After the
cantonment was completed and the troops began to arrive,
the divisional activities of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. centered largely in
the detection of violations having to do with the morale of
the troops. Five operatives were put to work on liquor
cases, all working together under cover. Twenty-six men
were sentenced for supplying soldiers with liquor, getting an
average of ten months’ imprisonment each.</p>

<p>The most notable case handled in Camp Grant, or in any
other camp, was that which resulted in the court-martial of
twenty-one negro soldiers. Louise <span class="nowrap">S——</span>, a white woman
visiting a white soldier at Camp Grant, was set upon and
assaulted by fifteen to twenty-one negro soldiers on the night
of May 19, the crime being committed on the reservation at
Camp Grant. At nine o’clock that evening Major General
Charles H. Martin, in command at Camp Grant, telephoned
to the local chief to meet him in town. He said his officers
had been unable to make any headway on the case, and asked
that it be taken up by the Department of Justice. The
League put men on the case, and in three days had twenty
of the culprits in custody, ultimately securing confessions implicating
all the others who were held. All of these men
were tried by court-martial; fifteen were convicted and dealt
with, five were let go, and one was declared insane. The
assistance of the civilian authorities and auxiliaries to the
military arm was so distinct in this case that General Martin
wrote a frank letter of thanks, in which he said: “I am
free to confess that until your entrance into the game, we
had not progressed very far, and I wish to make it of record<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span>
that it was principally due to your able and efficient service
that we finally succeeded.”</p>

<p>The nature and extent of the activities of the Rockford
division may be seen from the following summary: alien
enemy activities, 95; citizens’ disloyalty and sedition, 50;
sabotage, 5; anti-military activities, 13; propaganda, 13;
miscellaneous cases, 211. The Navy Department asked assistance
in 55 cases. Investigations made by the War Department
covered 21 for Military Intelligence; 242 under
the selective service regulations; 164 slackers; 45 character
and loyalty applications; 90 liquor cases; 44 cases of vice
and prostitution; 25 cases of desertions, and the collection
of over 200 maps and photographs for M.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;D. The
Department of State also reaches out as far as Rockford,
and the quietly efficient League handled forty-six passport
cases alone. The Treasury Department had ten cases under
War Risk, and the United States Shipping Board asked for
two investigations on character and loyalty.</p>

<p>In the nature of things, the activities of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. being
so wide, so impartial, and at times so energetic and aggressive,
friction of social or business sort was sure now and
then to arise. The only wonder is that there was not a great
deal more of it. Sometimes this grew out of spite work and
personal jealousy, and again resulted in clashes of a wider
and more distinct sort, resulting in something like community
cliques.</p>

<p>Mattoon, Illinois, had this sort of a tempest in a teapot
from some such causes. That town has a Merchants’ Association,
and this association, for reasons into which it is not
necessary to go here, but which perhaps had a personal basis
in some measure, saw fit to fine certain members of its body
who had contributed money for the organization of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
This caused considerable hard feeling. The Chief, P. A.
Erlach, asked permission to explain the purposes of the
League to the Merchants’ Association. This permission was
not granted. The Chief held a conference with Judge MacIntyre,
who suggested that the members who had been fined
by the Merchants’ Association might be subpoenaed and
brought to the court room, not for trial, but for the purpose
of clearing the situation, which did not seem to be good for
the community or the government. The Merchants’ Association<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
hired a lawyer to represent them, and a very warm
session was held, out of which, of course, nothing was derivable
except hard feeling. In the mutual recriminations, one
member of the Merchants’ Association was alleged to have
remarked at a certain time: “After this war is over, the
Germans will be the aristocrats of the world”—a belief
which seems to have lacked confirmation. All these matters,
however, did not succeed in destroying the usefulness
of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in Mattoon, where it did a great deal of
hard and conscientious work.</p>

<p>Probably the most interesting Mattoon investigation is
that of one O’H——, son of a wealthy farmer, who claimed
exemption on account of agricultural occupation. He was
alleged to be living in town and engaged in keeping books.
The League went into the history of the family and produced
proof that certain other paternal ancestors of
O’H—— had been engaged in the so-called Charleston
Riots during the civil war, when a band of men known as
“Copperheads,” among whom was an ancestor of
O’H——, had fired upon several Union soldiers with fatal
results in several instances. The Mattoon Chief of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
submitted to the Adjutant General at Springfield, Illinois,
a full brief of the investigation of the case of young
O’H——, also transcripts from Government records covering
the Charleston riots. Young O’H—— was sent to
Camp Zachariah for training.</p>

<p>Pastor Russell had certain followers in Mattoon, religious
fanatics of the sect known as Truth-Believers. They did not
believe in anything but the Truth, certainly not in Liberty
Loans, War Savings Stamps, or any war funds or activities.
Two members of the sect were arraigned, but the Federal
grand jury did not indict them because one was a woman
and the other concluded to go into the employment of the
Government at Washington.</p>

<p>Near Mattoon is a settlement of the peculiar sect known
as Ammish, whose religion tells them not to bear arms. They
opposed the selective draft, and although it was determined
to exempt their young men from actual drill, the community
preaching became so bad that a stiff investigation was made,
after which there was no more trouble.</p>

<p>The secret of the Mattoon fashion of investigation is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span>
told, but a number of case-reports close with the words:
“There has been no further complaint from the party.”
This covers the case of several citizens who did not buy as
many Liberty Bonds as they might, or were too free in their
talk about Germany as compared with this country.</p>

<p>Joliet, Illinois, has certain mills which harbor a large foreign
element, Austrians and others. Several arrests and one
internment put a quietus on German propaganda work among
these people. “We worked through local foreign priests in
whom they have confidence,” says the local chief, and he
adds: “We feel now that this hotbed of Austrianism is
a fertile field for the so-called Bolshevist movement, as the
sort of people most frequently dealt with are very susceptible
to this propaganda. They feel that they can express themselves
freely, now that the war is over, and they are pleased
at this opportunity. We believe that there is still much
work ahead before the Bolshevist movement ceases to be a
menace in these parts.”</p>

<p>Bloomington, Illinois, cites as its stand-out case the capture
of a German sailor, who was interned with the <i>Princess
Irene</i>, the German boat at Hoboken, and had broken parole.
The Chief says: “We had considerable other work to do in
conducting investigations and in stopping the propaganda
of loud-mouthed Germans.”</p>

<p>Rock Island, Illinois, is one of the most famous arsenal
towns in the country, the Ordnance Department having
erected large works there many years ago. All such posts
were danger foci during the war. Rock Island Division investigated
382 disloyalty and sedition cases, and 138 cases
of propaganda. The selective service regulations required
548 investigations. There were also the usual number of
cases taken on for the Housing Committee (it was a big
problem to house Rock Island’s war population), the Red
Cross, the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Commissioner, the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Marshal, the County
Sheriff, the Liberty Loan committees and war charities. Certainly
a very satisfactory record for a place where something
might have blown loose had enemy wishes come true!</p>

<p>Epworth, Illinois, worked in close touch with the State
Council of Defense. The Chief reports: “Our community
was loyal during the Civil War, and when this work came
on, we gladly put our shoulder to the wheel again. A few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span>
said things quite out of place, but you can believe we were
never Germanized here. Our worst enemies were those who
would rather part with their sons than with their coin—though
they did neither willingly. We examined some applicants
for overseas service.”</p>

<p>Alton, Illinois, just across the river from St. Louis, had
some investigations for Military Intelligence, and some overseas
investigations. The division had occasion to assist the
Special Agent of the Department of Justice in St. Louis a
number of times when quick action was needed.</p>

<p class="center">
WISCONSIN
</p>

<p>Justly or not, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, had the reputation
of being about the most German community in the most
nearly German state of the Union. No sweeping conclusions
need be advanced as to either side of this proposition herein,
for evidently, all said and done, Milwaukee is Milwaukee,
and is well known throughout the country. There was a
time, even previous to our entering the war against Germany,
when salesmen traveling out of Milwaukee were unable
to sell their goods to the retail trade throughout the
Middle West. They were obliged to go back to their houses
and to say that the city which they represented was in bad
repute. Just or not, these were the facts, and in time the
better-class business men of Milwaukee, most of whom have
not lacked in loyalty, began to see that some remedy must
be found for this prejudice existing against their city.</p>

<p>During the Civil War the Germans of Wisconsin, descendents
of the heavy German immigration of 1848 and
the years immediately following, had a splendid representation
in the Northern army. The sons of these men are among
the most prominent business men in Wisconsin and of Milwaukee
to-day, and it were worse than wrong loosely to accuse
them all of disloyalty to this country. Upon the other hand,
Milwaukee, being a heavy German settlement, did not lack
in wrong-headed persons who retained their allegiance to a
flag other than our own. These did the usual amount of
talking—perhaps more than the usual amount. For them
the Milwaukee Division of the American Protective League
had the same remedy that has been found efficient in other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span>
communities comprising a large foreign element or an element
with foreign sympathies. It went to work quietly and
steadily, showing good judgment and good sense, as well as
good patriotism. Mr. B. K. Miller was Chief of the Milwaukee
Division. The membership was made up of substantial
men of proven loyalty. The following table tells
the story of their work:</p>

<p class="p2">Sparta, Wisconsin, from the spelling of the suspect names
in the report, appears to be located in the heart of darkest
Germany. One Mr. <span class="nowrap">H——</span> of that vicinity declared that
a letter written to his father in anything but the German
language would be an insult. He was interviewed, and it
is believed that he has changed his idea by this time. Another
local pro-German volubly declared that the Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A.
was a “damn fraud.” He is also thinking it over. Gus
L—— would not allow a card with the admonition,
“Speak English,” to be placed in his store. It may affect
his application for his second papers. Carl <span class="nowrap">B——</span> was
called on for a subscription to the Red Cross, but turned
down the callers flat. He said he had never sworn obedience
to the United States and never would, adding: “They can
take me back to Germany or any place they like, and I don’t
care a damn how quick.” Such a man, it would seem,
ought to be obliged in the matter of such preferences. A
preacher, Rev. <span class="nowrap">E——</span>, seemed to talk German propaganda
rather than the Holy Scriptures. He was indicted. August
Y—— made seditious remarks in the open, and was reported
to the Department of Justice. Henry <span class="nowrap">B——</span> was
reported for threats he made against his neighbor for taking
part in the War Work campaign. Several alien enemies
who were applying for citizenship were held while their records
were looked up. Joe <span class="nowrap">M——</span> believed the Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A.
to be a “graft,” and thought our boys were sent to France<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span>
to be butchered. Duly interviewed about it. O. W. <span class="nowrap">S——</span>,
cashier of a bank, wrote a letter in which he stated his bank
would not take any Government certificates. He gave as his
reason that he was short of help, as one of his men was being
held in the army against his will and “against the wishes of
the community.” He was spoken to.</p>

<p>Neillsville, Wisconsin, apparently, was up on its toes. It
reports the investigation of an alien German Lutheran minister;
utterances against the President and the Government,
and the discovery of socialistic campaign literature for evidence
in the Socialist trial at Chicago. It searched the community
for the Socialist paper called “The Voice of the
People”; investigated the Russellite sect and looked up
the record of 118 petitioners for naturalization; investigated
juries in the trial of a murder case growing out of an attempt
to evade the draft, in which several people were wounded
and two killed, and investigated a Socialist candidate for
sheriff who made contributions to a fund for printing radical
literature. The foregoing civil activities were done in the
interest of the Department of Justice. Neillsville, for the
War Department, investigated a woman who was trying to
get information about the Edgewood Arsenals; assisted the
U. S. Marshals in arresting draft dodgers, and investigated
civilian applicants for overseas service and applicants for
commissions. The Chief apologizes for not having done
more!</p>

<p>Oshkosh, Wisconsin, had one hundred and eleven men—lawyers,
doctors, bankers, manufacturers and workmen—on
her A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. rolls. The investigations throughout the
war period totalled 343. There was much outspoken Germanism
in this district before the United States went into
the war, but after that, it died down. One old German,
when confronted by the operatives, said: “Vel, I dell you
vat I dink; it is so; I dink vat I dink. How can I helb id?
But I <i>say</i> not von dam vord—nefer!” A safe rule. “Since
the war ended,” says the Chief, “known sympathizers with
Germany have been as quiet as oysters here. When Germany
has been a republic for twenty years or so, I hope some of
these imported old bigots will soften.”</p>

<p>Racine, Wisconsin, has a population of 50,000. In a
slacker raid it gathered in 3,000, including a number of real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span>
dodgers and deserters. Two companies of State guards and
Spanish war veterans, organized into thirty-five squads, carried
out the League’s orders to perfection.</p>

<p>Berlin, Wisconsin, reports: “Berger carried this county
for Congress. We had some German propagandists who said
that America could not win the war. We quieted them.
Most of our work had to do with Liberty Bond campaigns,
Red Cross, exemption claims, and Food Administration matters.”</p>

<p>Eau Claire, Wisconsin, makes a clean-cut report on the
activities of that division, being in touch constantly with
the Agents of the Department of Justice and ready to act
at once at all times. D.&nbsp;J. complimented this division on
its compilation of evidence. The Chief says: “Among our
cases are several which proved vexatious. We succeeded in
silencing such disloyalists as we had. Notwithstanding the
fact that the war is over, we know there yet lies ahead of
all good citizens an enormous work of education in righting
and keeping right the obligation of the individual to the
Government.”</p>

<p class="center">
MINNESOTA
</p>

<p>The City of Duluth, at the head of the Great Lakes, lies
close to the edge of the great Northern wilderness whose
fastnesses might well beckon the evader as well as the
explorer or the discoverer. Her geographical situation
makes Duluth a sort of Mecca for dodgers, drifters and deserters,
and a good part of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. work at that point—and
hard work it often was—consisted in running down
these unwilling patriots who preferred the seclusiveness of
a logging camp, trapper’s shack, or even a logging drive, to
bearing arms under their country’s flag.</p>

<p>Olsen is a name somewhat indefinite in the upper Minnesota
country, but it was claimed by a deserter from Camp
Dodge who originally registered from Ely, Minnesota. The
entire Olsen genealogical tree was combed over, and many
shacks housing Olsens here and there in the woods were
examined, but the right Olsen was not found. At last an
operative hit upon the expedient of spreading word that
this particular Olsen was wanted to sign a receipt for some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span>
property that had been left to him. The proper Olsen came
into town, was arrested at once, and sent to Fort Snelling—the
victim of several kinds of misplaced confidence.</p>

<p>There came into Duluth a rather pitiful story of a young
girl of East Texas engaged to a <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> soldier who was taken
prisoner and sent to the interior of Germany. The prisoner
sent out a letter to his sweetheart which stated that he was
well treated. He also said that he was sending her his
watch as a souvenir, lest she might never see him again.
The girl took the watch to a jeweler. Inside of the works
there was a note which said that everything the prisoner
had written in the letter was not true, that his nose and
ears had been cut off by the Germans, so that he felt himself
unfit even to be seen by her again. The girl herself
lived at Nacogdoches and had met her Northern sweetheart
in a Southern camp.</p>

<p>From Ashland, Wisconsin, there was reported to the
Duluth office the name of one <span class="nowrap">J——</span>, a deserter. He was
traced out into the woods, found in the garret of a shack
whose owner disclaimed all knowledge of him, hauled down
and out and sent to Fort Snelling, all in jig time.</p>

<p>From Erie, Pennsylvania, there came to Duluth warning
that there probably would be on a steamer due to land at
that point a deserter from the service. The boat was met,
the deserter was found, and within thirty-six hours he was
on his way to Fort Snelling to repent at his leisure.</p>

<p>One <span class="nowrap">O——</span>, an Austrian or Russian, a mill hand, was
found in bed when an operative went after him as a draft
evader. He was so indiscreet as to say, “To hell with
America.” At that time the operative landed on him with
a stiff right, and <span class="nowrap">O——</span> went down for the count. The
short and simple annals of Mr. <span class="nowrap">O——</span>’s case read: “He
was dragged to jail with his toes up, put in a cell with his
toes still up, and left alone with his toes up. The next day
he was sent to Fort Snelling as a deserter.”</p>

<p>All the way from Great Falls, Montana, came a deserter
who thought he could hide himself in the North woods
around Duluth. As a matter of fact, he succeeded in doing
so for more than a month although he was traced here and
there in the forest. He located on a river-drive where he
worked for a time. This Mr. <span class="nowrap">C——</span> always went armed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span>
and was reported as dangerous, but this did not act as any
deterrent for A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. men. The evader was classified as
having strong I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. affiliations. He was chased far in
the woods, but will have to come out some time. When he
does, he will find the Duluth A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. ready to welcome him.</p>

<p>The totals for Duluth might be expected to run high.
Accordingly we need not be surprised to find that Duluth
reports 1,293 investigations of disloyalty and sedition; 3,287
men taken in slacker raids; 41 investigations for propaganda,
and 186 naturalization investigations.</p>

<p>Freeborn County, Minnesota, submitted a very optimistic
report: “The loyal folks were so plentiful that if any
pessimist happened to say the wrong thing about the Red
Cross or the Liberty Loans, he was promptly reported. A
few fines of $500 each in the district court soon stopped all
disloyalty talk. The Non-Partisan League was watched
closely but we got nothing disloyal at their meetings and
could find no openly disloyal acts. They have an unusual
proportion of persons of German extraction in their membership.
At the beginning of the war a good many farmers
tried to keep their sons at home, often using strongly colored
affidavits. Some honestly felt that the duty to furnish
food was greater than the duty to fight, which attitude
sometimes led to unfounded accusations against them.”</p>

<p>Wilkin County, Minnesota, watched Non-Partisan League
activities closely. Members of this none too loyal organization
talked less freely when they learned that they were
being watched. The community had some clergymen with
strong German tendencies, but these also experienced a
change of heart. One German alien, registered at Omaha,
Nebraska, who had left without permission, was arrested
until the Department of Justice at St. Paul could take him
over. The fact of his arrest created a large silence among
the pro-Germans of the region.</p>

<p>Grant County, Minnesota, has a little report. “A few
minor investigations of false statements about deferred
classifications were made. We got the facts. Our County
is small, no large settlements, and everyone knows practically
everybody else, so there was little for us to do.”</p>

<p>Winona, Minnesota, sends in the best kind of a report—with
few or no figures under most lettered heads. Winona<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span>
has about 20,000 inhabitants, and is a small farming community
with a floating population. Much of the work of
the division was in stopping local gossip and loose talking.
The League did, however, locate one deserter, who was duly
turned over.</p>

<p class="center">
MISSOURI
</p>

<p>The tracing of a deserter may take a hundred pages in a
file. A certain man registered in St. Louis, but never turned
in his questionnaire. He was classified by the Adjutant
General of Missouri as a deserter, and A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. was requested
to find him. Search revealed him in James City,
Pennsylvania. The chief of police of a nearby town found
the man in bed. The deserter, whose name may be called
Bates, resisted fiercely. It was stated of him that he was
the first man the chief of police ever arrested who succeeded
in breaking a pair of handcuffs. He fought all the time until
he was put in jail. Mr. Bates, it is to be hoped, fought
equally well in the army. He certainly got his chance to
do so.</p>

<p>D. W. <span class="nowrap">B——</span>, from St. Louis, was once in the 108th
Infantry, but vanished therefrom, leaving his uniform in
New York with a friend. One paragraph, the last page in
the file, will cover the case of Mr. <span class="nowrap">B——</span>: “As subject
was apprehended in Buffalo, the commanding officer at
Fort Niagara was communicated with, and he detailed a
sergeant to come to Buffalo on December 17. The sergeant
took <span class="nowrap">B——</span> into custody and conveyed him to Fort Niagara,
where he is at present.”</p>

<p>Kansas City, among other cases, turned in a love letter
written by a local young lady to a Japanese, Heroshirmo, at
present living in Japan. The letter begins: “Dear Heroshirmo:
How I want to write to you pages and pages of
something, I am not sure what. I want to tell you first
about the beautiful summer that has just passed, how beautiful
the trees and flowers were, how infinite and blue the
sky”—but perhaps that will be enough.</p>

<p>The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. noticed the post-mark and thought that this
sort of correspondence ought to be looked into. It should.
The Japanese had once stopped in Kansas City as a member<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span>
of a Commission on its way to Washington, and had visited
local friends. No international plot was unveiled in this
case. Just the trees and flowers were discovered to be beautiful
and the sky very blue. To be sure, the writer being
a woman, the letter had a postscript: “Just because I have
been sick, would you like to send me a genuine Japanese
kimona? I must tell you that all of the first page of your
last letter except the first few lines were cut out by the censor.
D——n the war.”</p>

<p>Jefferson City, Missouri, has jurisdiction over several
counties but the division consisted of only twenty-one members.
These men were of great value to the Department
of Justice at Kansas City. The sparsely settled nature of
the country around Jefferson City meant a great deal of
automobile travel. The Chief says he has traveled as high
as ninety-five miles in his own car on one case. This meant
a vast amount of work for the small membership of the
League at that point. It acquitted itself admirably.</p>

<p>Clinton, Missouri, faithfully performed a large volume of
routine work such as comes to most of the divisions—some
three hundred cases in all, under various headings. The
Chief concludes: “Our activities have been abundant.
We mean to continue our organization here until there is
no further need for it. Our personnel is made up of the
best men in this county. Our system of warning by red-white-and-blue
cards has been adopted in many States and
by the National Council of Defense.”</p>

<p>Monett, Missouri, had some trouble from the fact that
drafted men were at first able to obtain alcoholic beverages
there. This was stopped by the local League. There was
considerable propaganda by word of mouth in this locality
which was choked off. One deserter defied all local officers
to capture him and take him back to camp. Nevertheless
he was taken, returned to camp, court-martialed and sentenced
to a term in the federal prison. As a whole, the people
of this community are law abiding 100-percent Americans.
Hence the League’s work was light.</p>

<p>Fayette, Missouri: “Thirty investigations resulted in reclassifying
twenty-five men. We arrested three camp deserters
and two men for disloyal acts. Found three men
hoarding sugar and made them take it back. In some cases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</span>
we just warned parties that their conduct had been reported
to be reprehensible, and evidence was produced by them to
prove their later love and loyalty to the United States.”</p>

<p class="center">
IOWA
</p>

<p>Des Moines, Iowa, the very prosperous capital of the prosperous
state of Iowa, had an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. man attached to the
Intelligence Service of the Army. He spoke German fluently
and in order to investigate conditions inside a neighboring
camp, he pretended to be a conscientious objector, thus being
confined to barracks with other conscientious objectors, some
real and some camouflage. A picked War Department Committee,
including the Governor of the State, was combing
out these objectors and ran across the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. man. The
latter was unable to explain, and had to go through as a
conscientious objector and listen to a good lecture to boot!</p>

<p>Des Moines had another case of a fine looking young man
who weighed about 175 pounds and who sported a clever little
military mustache. He was caught in a slacker drive and
on the following morning hesitatingly handed the agent a
telegram sent by his father, which read: “I have told you
that damned eye-brow on your upper lip would get you
into trouble. Tell the Government I say you are only twenty—you
look older, but act younger. If you wish to please
your father, enlist in the Navy.” The son enlisted.</p>

<p>Iowa City, Iowa, is a university town, a good, peaceful
and thrifty community and one of the most useful in the
West. The foreign element in that district has been rather
Bohemian than German, but the population has the usual
admixture. There are two precincts populated by Mennonites,
whose religion is work and not war. One of these good
folk refused to buy Liberty Bonds but sold enough walnut
logs from his farm to make several thousand gun stocks.
This man was finally persuaded to buy as many dollars
in bonds as his logs made gun stocks. Some conscientious
objectors from Camp Dodge were sent out to farm among
these Mennonite brothers and thus escaped the draft, whereas
local loyal farmers’ sons had to go to the front. This created
bitter feeling. Most of these dodgers were recalled.</p>

<p>Oskaloosa, Iowa, had its own share of local wrangles over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span>
League war activities. One suspect was brought up under
charges of disloyalty by reason of many reports coming in
against him. He was indicted and the local Chief says:
“I have no doubt of his conviction had he not died since.”</p>

<p>Hardin County, Iowa, had an organization which kept
this community decent and orderly and up to the front in
all of the war activities. The chief was a member of the
Bureau of Military Affairs for Hardin County, which had
charge of all the war work. He was also on the County
Committee of Four on Military Instruction, whose duty it
was to instruct and train drafted men. Other members of
the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. were on the Legal Advisory Board and also
were of assistance to the drafted men. A steady-going and
firm-stepping community.</p>

<p>Corning, Iowa, worked in the usual unostentatious way
with the Food and Fuel administrations, etc. Two indictments
were brought against a man who blocked war activities,
the fines going to the Red Cross.</p>

<p>Green County reports: “All quiet in this section. Very
few Germans in our county. None showed disloyalty except
one old German woman who wrote to her son, a missionary
in China. Her family promised to keep her loyal.
We examined into the German Lutheran schools and German
language assemblages. Nothing of much consequence.”</p>

<p>Decorah, Iowa, is another peaceful community in a peaceful
State. Little or no trouble was met here. “The A. P.
L. was organized rather late,” says the report, “owing to
the fact that we had a most thorough and efficient Defense
Council at work.”</p>

<p>Indianola, Iowa, is also a place of peace. The League
had been organized only a short time when the Armistice
broke, and there were but few activities. “Indianola has
a rural population,” says the Chief, “with a very small
percentage of foreign born. No trouble of any consequence.”</p>

<p class="center">
SOUTH DAKOTA.
</p>

<p>Aberdeen, South Dakota, must have been a good talking
point for German propagandists, because it reports 122 cases
of propaganda by word of mouth, and 128 cases of propaganda
by printed matter. The division was called on to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span>
take active part in the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. labor troubles, and this part
of its work is described at some length in the Chief’s report:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thousands of I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.’s drift here at harvest time. Their
jungles sometimes contain as many as one thousand men.
They take charge of whole trains, and force railroads to carry
them wherever they wish. They have forced the city authorities
in small communities to send them a specified amount of
food, and have defied the authorities of larger cities to control
them. By their methods of sabotage, murder and arson
they have terrorized certain sections of this state and destroyed
millions of dollars’ worth of property. In the summer
of 1917 the annual influx started. The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. was called
on for assistance, and decidedly effective measures were
adopted. Home Guards and citizens were organized—later
called by a D.&nbsp;J. officer “the Klu Klux Klan of the Prairies.”
Anyhow, this section of the prairies was soon clear. In consequence,
a strike was declared by the Minneapolis branch of
the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. and some of their gunmen were sent out. The
property of the Chief of Police at Aberdeen was burnt. In
less than two weeks four of these men were under arrest and
two of them are now serving sentences in the Federal Penitentiary
at Leavenworth. The methods adopted by this branch
of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. have proved efficacious. Thousands of dollars’
worth of property have been saved.</p>
</div>

<p>As Aberdeen is located in one of the Non-Partisan League
districts, and as reports have come from nearby towns denoting
a large percentage of pro-Germanism, it may be well
to quote further from the report of this division. The
Chief says that one family living in Hecla, strongly pro-German,
declared they would never be taken alive. The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
took over the case. One man was shot resisting arrest. Five
members of the family were arrested and two were convicted,
while one remains to be tried. “This stopped pro-German
utterances in that community,” says the Chief, “and materially
aided in the sale of bonds.”</p>

<p>In December, 1917, Fred <span class="nowrap">H——</span> of Aberdeen was interned
for pro-German utterances. His wife turned state’s
evidence on members of the local German club where members
had been fined for speaking the English language. Four
of the leading spirits of this club were taken into custody,
one of them the publisher of three German language newspapers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span>
of wide circulation which were openly pro-German.
This man had sent to von Bernstorff $10,000, ostensibly to
be used for the German Red Cross—all of it raised from
readers of his publication through the sale of the “iron
ring.” This man was sentenced and fined $500. An associate
editor of the same string of papers was interned also.
One of the parties was president of the South Dakota
German-American Alliance, and published a German language
paper at Sioux Falls. He was charged with writing
a letter which reads as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have never given any declaration of loyalty and never will
do it, nor subscribe to any Liberty Loan. The name is to me
already an emetic because hypocritical and misleading. That
a man perhaps buys bonds for business considerations, I can
understand, but I myself couldn’t do it without thinking that
my $50 or $100 might perhaps buy the explosive which American
accomplices of the allied plunderbund might throw on the
house of my mother.</p>
</div>

<p>The writer of the above, as head of the German-American
Alliance, raffled a picture of the crew of the <i>Deutschland</i>
after our declaration of war, and sold souvenirs from the
boat, remitting the funds to New York German centers. He
was sentenced to ten years in the Federal penitentiary.</p>

<p>The active Chief of Aberdeen also caught H. M. <span class="nowrap">H——</span>,
a former lieutenant in the German Navy and an ex-instructor
in the Naval School at Hamburg, who was also active in
the German-American Alliance. He got five years in the
Federal penitentiary for urging young men of draft age not
to enlist. Another alien enemy whose papers show that he
once had wealthy connections in Germany, although he was
engaged in making a scanty living at baling hay, was reported
as a Prussian and believed to be dangerous. Yet
another, William <span class="nowrap">B——</span>, was picked up in Aberdeen and
told a tale that sounded like one by Deadwood Dick. He
said he lived in the mountains of California with his uncle,
who was a smuggler. He was found to be communicating
with the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W., and was sent to a detention camp. Another
arrest was made, of Ed. <span class="nowrap">R——</span>, a wealthy farmer who
stated he would rather see his daughter in a house of prostitution
than a member of the Red Cross. He was sentenced to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span>
five years in the penitentiary, and this has discouraged the
expression of such sentiments near Aberdeen.</p>

<p>Now, if there were nothing else whatever printed in these
pages, the foregoing would show the necessity for such an
organization as the American Protective League, even in
communities far away from manufacturing centers and not
supposed to be governed by the foreign element. The report
of the Chief of the Aberdeen Division affords grave reading
and matter for grave consideration. In that one little community,
which does not turn in memoranda of all its cases,
there were 312 Department of Justice cases, 156 War Department
cases, and three Navy Department cases. Seventeen
persons were arrested or interned. Perhaps the most
noteworthy of the recommendations made by the local Chief
is this: “It has been the experience of this branch that
the communities reached by the German language publications
have been decidedly disloyal. It is our opinion that
action should be urged upon Congress to discontinue the
foreign language press in America.” These last are words
of gold. They ought to be remembered by every man holding
office in the United States and by every man seeking the
suffrages of real American citizens. The time for mincing
matters with these gentry has gone by.</p>

<p class="center">
NORTH DAKOTA
</p>

<p>Fargo, North Dakota, hands in a report which varies in
one important particular from those received from neighboring
districts. The division was not making trouble enough
for the rampant pro-Germans in Fargo, so the League
turned around and investigated some of its own officers.
None the less, the report tells of a story of accomplishment,
there being 101 disloyalty and sedition cases, 109 cases under
the Selective Service Act, and eight cases of enemy sympathizers
who threatened the life of the President.</p>

<p class="center">
KANSAS
</p>

<p>It will be no surprise to those who know Kansas to learn
that this ultra-progressive, prosperous, energetic State was
unswervingly loyal throughout the war, and had few cases
of any kind to report. A few sentences quoted from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span>
reports of several representative little towns will serve to
show the Kansas war temperature varied from normal but
slightly, if at all.</p>

<p>Oswego, Kansas, reports succinctly: “One hundred percent
patriotism—no aliens.”</p>

<p>White City, Kansas, says: “Ours is a community of loyal
citizens. We spoke to a few about talking too much. Nothing
serious.”</p>

<p>Council Grove, Kansas, proved to be a great deal quieter
than it used to be in the days of the Santa Fé trail. The
Chief says: “We had a few pro-German sympathizers
whose cases we turned over to the Department of Justice to
investigate.”</p>

<p class="center">
NEBRASKA
</p>

<p>The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. Division at Omaha, Nebraska, was organized
at a rather late date, July 1, 1918. The Armistice shattered
the activities at a time when there were three hundred members
of the League, each man ready to do what was asked
of him. The Omaha Chief reports sixty cases of disloyalty
and sedition, and several thousand investigations made in
conjunction with D.&nbsp;J. as a result of the slacker raids, as
well as 700 in connection with the Department of Labor.</p>

<p>The Chief at Hastings, Nebraska, says: “I did not know
the work would be so extensive, or that there would be so
much to do. We have investigated some cases for Omaha,
and have done a great deal of work on draft cases for the
state and county boards. We have been glad to do this
work, and I am thankful that I could help my country
this much.”</p>

<p>Callaway, Nebraska, has a grievance: “I had one genuine
case of seditious utterance, but we did not get the evidence.
This man was elected State Senator by the Non-Partisan
League. He worked against the Liberty Bond
drive. Fortunately, this year our Senator is not of his
sort politically.”</p>

<p>David City, Nebraska, reports the usual routine work.
One pro-German was taken into custody for making seditious
remarks, and was bound over to the grand jury for
trial. The local Chief reports that his organization is being
held intact against any future emergency.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>
THE STORY OF THE SOUTH</h3>

<p>The South is, in its percentage as to population, the
finest, cleanest, truest and most loyal part of the United
States to-day. It holds more of the native born Americans,
fewer of the foreign born, and fewer alien enemies than any
like extent of our National possessions. The only pure-bred
American population, sufficiently so to entitle it to a distinct
origin-color of its own on the government census maps, lies
along the crest of the southern Appalachians. There, in
parts of Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia,
Alabama, lower Virginia, there are Americans who for
generations have known no admixture of any foreign blood.
You will find illiteracy there, poverty, small industrial
development. That has come about by reason of a topography
which has left transportation undeveloped. The people
have been held back from the westbound progress of
the nation almost as though caught by the cleats of the
great flume through which poured our early Scotch-Irish, Indian-fighting,
wilderness-conquering ancestry. But it is the
finest of gold that those cleats have caught—a clean-bred,
persistent type, of the highest honor, the highest courage,
the highest intellectual quality, the highest physical qualities.
Here and here alone you will find a true American
type, come down with little change from our Colonial days.
Would God that every state in the North and West had
these men as the real inheritors of America, and not the
snarling mob of foreigners who in the last few decades have
come to be called American citizens. We have seen in some
part how loyal these last have been, how much they cared
for the flag of America.</p>

<p>The stock of our Highlands has furnished us many strong
men, many of our greatest leaders, our greatest statesmen.
Above all, it is fierce fighting stock. It has been held back
by lack of education. These stark mountaineers are far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span>
more illiterate than were their grand-parents. To-day,
in a Cumberland cabin, you may find a Latin grammar,
or a tragedy in the original Greek, of which the owner
will say, “I kaint read none of hit. Grandpap fotched it
across the mountings when he come.” “Across the mountains”
lay the Carolinas and Old Virginia, seats of the most
cultured and aristocratic life this country ever knew, and
equal to the best of any land. When we lost that, we lost
the flower of the American civilization. We never shall replace
it. There is no America to-day. There never can be,
unless the seed of the old American stock—never lacking
in leaders—one day shall raise its voice as of old in councils
where it will find hearkening.</p>

<p>The South is a wide country, covering a certain diversity
of nature, but it remains singularly like throughout its borders.
Politically it is still the slave of the color question,
whose end no man can see. That same question restricts
the South largely to agriculture. Of late, Northern money
and methods have been reaching out for the raw wealth of
Southern mines and forests, even farming lands. It is in
respect of these later slight changes in the character of the
southern life that the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. has found its main function
there. Had it not been for imported labor, the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
would have had no alien and seditious cases, no propaganda
and no disloyalty to report, because it is absolutely true
that our Southern States, which once thought themselves
constitutionally justified in secession, to-day are more loyal
to the American flag man for man, town for town, state for
state, than any or all the remaining states in this Union.</p>

<p>This is true; and yet it is also altogether true that a few
Southern States furnished more cases of desertion or draft
evasion than thrice that number of states in any other portion
of the Union, even though with heavy foreign-born
population. How can these two statements be reconciled?</p>

<p>It is easy, and the level-headed A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. chiefs time and
again have made it plain in their reports. A large percent
of the selective service work had to do with brave young
fighting men to whom liberty and personal freedom made
the breath of their nostrils. Many of them were ignorant—more
is the pity. While we have coddled the treacherous
European immigrant, we have forgotten our own children.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</span>
Better had we thrown the maudlin Statue of Liberty into
the sea, or turned its face about the other way!</p>

<p>The young Southerner who could not read grandpap’s
Latin book, or any other book, who saw no daily paper and
knew nothing of the outside world, knew only that he did
not want to fight in a war of which he knew nothing and
in which he did not think he or his had any stake. Nobody
had threatened him, no men had stolen anything of his, he
did not know where Germany was, and he had never seen
a German to learn to hate him. Why should he fight? He
concluded he would not fight. He would just hide till this
war was over, because it was none of his war.</p>

<p>Very much of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. work in the South had to do
with getting into the young man’s comprehension that our
Flag was in danger; that our women and children had been
killed by men that did not fight like men but like brutes.
Once that got into the mountain man’s mind, the day for
desertion was past and gone. There are no braver or more
skilled fighting men in the world than in these Southern
hills. There are none more loyal. They did their part and
were ready to do it wherever called. They helped win the
war for America as well as those from richer states. Now
that the war is over, let America forget Europe’s sordid
sycophants, the grinning reservists of the “unbeaten” German
Army, and turn attention to these, her own children—no
cuckoo product without an ancestry to claim, who have
no love for this country beyond their love for this country’s
easy money.</p>

<p class="center">
MARYLAND
</p>

<p>Largely Southern in its population, traditions and political
sympathies, yet Northern in its aggressive spirit and industrial
enterprise, the city of Baltimore perhaps is entitled to
be called “American” more than any other big city on the
Atlantic seaboard. It has always been American, and in
this war has only proven anew what has always been known
by those who knew Baltimore. A hundred years or so ago,
in the War of 1812, its citizens fought and fell gloriously
in defense of their city before the British. A beautiful
monument commemorates their heroism. In this war, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</span>
was no city in the country more loyal to our Government and
our Allies.</p>

<p>Let it not be thought, however, that the enemy was inactive
in Baltimore. Trouble, active and potential, was present
at all times. That it did not flare up into open destruction
was no fault of the trouble-makers. Like all ports of entry,
Baltimore has a considerable foreign element. Thousands
of foreigners were employed in its shipbuilding plants, on
its docks, and in the Bessemer steel works located near the
city. Of pro-Germans and alien enemies there was a plenty.
Many of them, indeed, remembering the landing of the
<i>Deutschland</i> at Baltimore before the war, would have welcomed
and aided a wholesale submarine raid by the enemy—were
this possible.</p>

<p>However, this did not come to pass, nor did many other
things come to pass that were justifiably feared. The pro-German,
the alien enemy, the agitator, the Bolshevist were
held safe at all times. Baltimore’s many industries were
guarded well. Happily, that industry which has given her
world-wide fame—the oyster industry—required no protection,
and it is a pleasure to record that the nation’s supply
of sea-food was uninterrupted during the war.</p>

<p>A prolific source of trouble for the Baltimore Division lay
in the city’s proximity to the national capital. The overcrowded
condition of Washington during the war forced a
huge overflow of population into Baltimore, and thus doubled
the amount of work that otherwise would probably have
been required. This work was tackled with energy and
efficiency by the Baltimore Division, which was one of the
very largest for a city of its size in the country. When the
Armistice came, there were 2,500 operatives engaged in the
multifold activities of the League. The following report does
not begin to tell the full story of their achievement:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</span></p>

<p class="p2">Baltimore Division organized and was on the job during
the very first month of the war. Its first Chief was Mr.
Edmund Leigh, who solved the many knotty problems of
organization and finance which arose in the early stages of
the League’s growth. Mr. Leigh was succeeded by Mr. William
J. Neale in August, 1918, who acted as head of the
division until November, 1918, when Mr. Tilghman G. Pitts
became Chief.</p>

<p class="center">
VIRGINIA
</p>

<p>Norfolk, Virginia, was fortunate in having as its chief a
gentleman very prominent in all the war charities, and also
of such generosity of nature that he paid all the expenses
of the League out of his own pocket.</p>

<p>Conditions might have been much worse at this seaport
locality, for only eight cases of alien enemy activity are
listed, and five cases of disloyalty and sedition. This division,
however, was able to do a great deal of work for the
War Department, and among other matters found one illicit
still and made four I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. investigations. Another phase
of the work was supplying the M.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;D. officer at the Army
Supply Base—Quartermaster’s Terminal—near Norfolk,
with many photographs of alien enemies and slackers. The
Division had operatives in Army and Navy headquarters,
among workmen, etc., and had such men included in its
personnel as bookkeepers, timekeepers and others whose work
was much appreciated by Military Intelligence. The chief
had twenty-one assistants, all good men.</p>

<p>White Sulphur Springs, Virginia, had one typical pro-German
case. Adolph <span class="nowrap">S——</span>, a baker of this town, held
certain opinions which would not strictly classify as American.
When asked to purchase War Savings Stamps, he expressed
himself as follows: “To hell with your War Savings
Stamps. If Uncle Sam didn’t have money enough to finance
the war, why did he go into it? When the American soldiers
get to France, you’ll find they won’t do anything but run
like hell.”</p>

<p>He said a great deal more in similar vein, which “was
hardly suitable,” says the Chief’s report, “for polite ears.”
In the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> District Court, at Charleston, <span class="nowrap">S——</span> confessed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</span>
to a violation of the Espionage Act, was fined $100 and sentenced
to two years in the penitentiary.</p>

<p>Lynchburg, Virginia, reports that it was rather quiet.
One thing it did was to draw the fangs of an organization
which was formed to punish such pro-Germans and war
obstructionists as the law did not touch. The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. has
always done its work hand in hand with the law, and
throughout the war has resolutely set its face against anything
savoring of lynch law.</p>

<p>Considerable local trouble arose from returned negro soldiers,
discharged from service, who stated that they had
saved the world from Hun oppression and were entitled to
recognition. These statements had effect on the ignorant
population, and it is firmly believed by the Chief that the
“South has a problem on its hands in this connection which
will require considerable time, effort and patience, if not
bloodshed, to solve.” Any one acquainted in the least degree
with the great problem of the South will realize the
gravity and sincerity of this comment.</p>

<p class="center">
WEST VIRGINIA
</p>

<p>There were “hot times in the old town” of Hinton, West
Virginia, in good part by reason of the activities of one man,
the local Chief, who, for some time was cook, captain and
mate of the Nancy brig. Local disloyalty induced him to
go to Washington and ask government help, and the League
organization followed. One pro-German in Hinton had the
Kaiser’s picture on the wall. It is not there now. The
head of this family was a locomotive engineer. The Chief
notified railroad officials not to allow him to handle any
troop trains. Another engineer expressed the belief that a
troop train was carrying “some more fish bait.” He was
also relieved of any future work on troop trains. Two
school teachers, after talking with the Chief, hung up four
United States flags and began to sing all the latest war
songs as well as take an active part in Loan drives, Red
Cross work, etc. The largest hotel in the town did not speak
well of the war, and the Chief notified the officers in charge
of troop trains to get their meals somewhere else. A local
newspaper printed an article reflecting on the Red Cross<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</span>
canteen. “I had all the papers publish an article over my
signature,” says the Chief, “that any criticism of the Red
Cross should be addressed to the Bureau of Investigation at
Washington. For this I have been commended by the Red
Cross membership.” It appears that he ought to be commended
for his own record, which, on the face of it, is in the
blue-ribbon class.</p>

<p class="center">
NORTH CAROLINA
</p>

<p>Lexington, N. C., is in the southern mountains. The Chief
says: “Owing to the peculiar reaction of the mountaineer’s
philosophy to the draft laws, many of them ‘stepped back’
into the ‘brush’ to wait until the war was over. We spent
much time in traveling around among the lumber jacks and
sent out word to many delinquents. It was a simple thing
to reach most of these men through the medium of some
trusted friend—much simpler than sending armed men into
the laurel thickets after the fugitives. I don’t believe there
is one case out of ten in western North Carolina where any
of our men avoided the draft through a malicious motive.
Whenever a friendly adviser could reach them to explain
the situation, the majority of them gladly came out. We
often made trips of from thirty to fifty miles into the
isolated sections. At one point thirty miles from a railroad
we got information which was sent across the sea to France
and stopped an undesirable appointee to Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A. work
there. Some humorous things came up in our mountain
travels. One day our road dwindled to an almost obliterated
trail with grass growing all over it. We sighted an
old woman, the first human being seen for several hours,
and asked her if that was the right way to Doeville. The
old woman looked at us with great contempt, and remarked:
‘Lord bless us, you-all is right <i>in</i> Doeville dis minute!’”</p>

<p>The Chief of Lexington says that not everyone understands
the mountain boys and that they certainly make excellent
fighters when in the army. “One of them in my
district,” reports the Chief, “had to be run down and
captured by his own father, who delivered him over to the
authorities for military service. This boy was the first of
his company to distinguish himself in France.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</span></p>

<p>The Chief of Salisbury, North Carolina, Division sends in
his final report in homely and convincing phrases, a mark of
the good common sense employed in his work. One pro-German
was called into the office and the Chief said to him:
“Mr. ——, I hear that the next time you and your family
come to town over the public road, you are going to be
blown up without any warning.” The man struck the table
with his fist and said: “I’d like to know how! The public
road is mine and I’m going to travel on it.” The Chief said:
“So our ships had a public highway to Europe. The Germans
have destroyed vessels, women and children without
warning. What do you think of it?” The pro-German
thought this over a minute and exclaimed: “Why hasn’t
some one talked to me like that before? I never saw it that
way before.”</p>

<p>Hickory, N. C., says: “Our work was largely educational.
We had no aliens—all native born American citizens.
Thirty of our leading citizens constituted the membership
of the League. When we went to work, all the ’aginners’
who were against the war got on the right side. Especially
was this true after the amended espionage act went
into effect. In my judgment,” says the Chief, “the psychological
effect of an organization that could be felt but not
seen helped wonderfully in bringing to their right senses
the small minority that were not in right at the start.”</p>

<p>Durham, N. C., pulled off one raid on a circus crowd and
got ten slackers. “Our community has a foreign element,”
says the Chief, “and is above the average in respect to law
and order. Our members were prominent in the war activities.”</p>

<p class="center">
SOUTH CAROLINA
</p>

<p>Anderson, S. C., says: “Our organization has been
anxious to answer every call. There are practically no
foreigners in this section, so violations of the war measures
have been almost negligible. Most of our work has been
making reports for overseas service. The men all consider
it a great honor to have been members of the League.”</p>

<p>A man whom we may call Benny Vogel deserted from the
105th Infantry at Camp Wadsworth, South Carolina. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</span>
some way, he found his way to Schenectady, New York,
where he proceeded casually to marry a young lady of that
city, under date of April 19, 1918. The wife was watched.
The deserter was caught and returned for punishment.</p>

<p>St. Matthews, S. C., reports: “On the whole there was
little enemy activity. We unearthed six cases of discharged
soldiers drawing government money who were not entitled
to it, and eight cases of parties receiving allotments from
soldiers for incorrect amounts. We changed such undesirable
sentiment as existed in our community, and with tact
and judgment rather than by drastic measures. We think
our community is among the most loyal of any in America
and doubt seriously if there is one per cent disloyalty here.
Some who at first were lukewarm changed, and we knew
it was due to the policy adopted by our organization. We
worked on the Sunday law and the fuel laws, the food regulations,
etc., all in a quiet way, but, we think, with good results
throughout our county.”</p>

<p class="center">
GEORGIA
</p>

<p>All sorts of stories show in the League files. One regarding
submarine bases along the Georgia and Carolina coast
was traced down to the purchase of a piece of land by a
former grocery clerk, a naturalized German, who resided in
Savannah for many years. He was outspoken in his sympathy
with Germany before the United States entered the
war. A report made by the Navy Department to the National
Directors of the League states:</p>

<p>“On January 6, 1918, this man was tried in the city court
of Savannah and found guilty of violating the prohibition
laws. He was fined $400 and sentenced to six months on
the chain gang. Before he had fully served his sentence he
was re-arrested by the United States Marshal on a presidential
warrant and subsequently interned.” The brief phrase
“presidential warrant” covered many and many a case of
naturalized Germans who became too loquacious in this
country before and after we entered the war.</p>

<p>Atlanta, Georgia, had a nice scare about the report that a
German U-boat captain had landed and was on his way to
Atlanta, dressed in an American officer’s uniform. Operatives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</span>
were out and trailed every military or quasi-military
looking man on the streets or anywhere else. Their first
haul included a major from the Judge Advocate General’s
office and a Judge from the Federal Court. The next alarm
came from two operatives who trailed an officer just off the
train, who turned out to be a colonel of the Quartermaster’s
Corps, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A. The latter was able to make his escape.
The Chief adds: “Just how many suspects were held up
that night it would be difficult to state. Operative No. 3
turned in a report of his activities the next morning. It
seemed he had held up the following personnel: One Lieutenant-Colonel,
sixteen Majors, twenty-three Captains, forty-two
Lieutenants, one Lieutenant-Commander, three Ensigns,
and seven Sergeants—a total of ninety-two suspects.” He
closed his report with the following heartfelt remarks:
“Well, I didn’t know what kind of uniform the German
had. Besides, every man I stopped was a blond. I didn’t
stop any other sort.” D.&nbsp;J. reported it was satisfied that
no German submarine officer had visited Atlanta.</p>

<p class="center">
ALABAMA
</p>

<p>Birmingham, Alabama, was one of the most active and
interesting divisions of the League. It took on 1,849 cases
under the Selective Service Act, 76 investigations of pro-Germans,
123 cases of deserters, and 153 Red Cross loyalty
reports, besides a large list of general war activities. Some
of the star cases of deserter hunting at Birmingham are
reported in another chapter.</p>

<p>Like many another community, Birmingham also had its
wireless case, and like most cases of the sort throughout the
country, it created much excitement in the division while
it lasted. Certain mysterious light flashes, supposed to be
signals, were reported along the top of a high hill on the outskirts
of the city. Operatives detailed on the case could
learn nothing, but still reports kept coming in. Finally, one
astute visiting chief followed a high-powered transmission
line along the mountain and found that the limb of a tree
at a certain spot would touch the wire when swayed by the
wind. The repeated rubbing had worn away the insulation,
exposing the bare wire. When the limb came in contact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</span>
with the wire, especially during a rainy night, a spark would
be made when the limb and wire separated: The Chief adds:
“When the limb was cut off, we received no further reports
of mysterious signals.” There have been bluish-white lights
which some thought indicated a wireless outfit in operation.</p>

<p>Montgomery, Alabama, reports one of those curious cases
which were sometimes met with in the course of the League’s
investigations. This was a straight-goods, dyed-in-the-wool,
bona-fide conscientious objector. His name was W. A.
P——, a farmer who had a son in the draft, but who
needed him on the farm. He accompanied the boy to the
examination board, after the young man had been arrested
by the sheriff. He brought his Bible to the board and tried
to prove that he was justified in his objections; that he was
responsible for the care of this boy; that the Lord had given
him that duty and no one else. The old man was violently
opposed to bloodshed and quoted the scriptural words,
“Thou shalt not kill,” and “Children, obey your parents.”
The Chief had a long talk with him at his farm. He admitted
that he told his son not to answer questions, and that
he had another son who had attained his eighteenth birthday
and had not registered. The Chief told him to be careful
or he would get into trouble. He said, “I am not getting
into any trouble; it is you people who are provoking the
wrath of God.” All the agent could do was to tell him that
he must come before the United States Commissioners.
P—— was brought in to the Committee, and bound over
to the grand jury. Before the trial, he stood up and remarked,
“Let us have a word of prayer,” and prayed fervently
for several minutes. He carried his Bible with him
at all times. <span class="nowrap">P——</span> seemed to be generous. “He came
to Montgomery and brought a couple of gallons of nice syrup
for the Deputy and Commissioners,” says the Chief. One
would think that the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. would be glad to have peace
at any price in such surroundings, even without syrup.</p>

<p>Selma, Alabama, is another one of the loyal Southern
communities. “We kept down seditious utterances,” says
the Chief. “Without doubt we have had a most wholesome
effect on our citizenry by letting every one know that this
was not a time for anything that was not one hundred per
cent American. I do not believe there was a greater force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</span>
for good in the State of Alabama than the American Protective
League.”</p>

<p class="center">
FLORIDA
</p>

<p>Cocoa, Florida, is not far from one of the Government
shipyards, and so had had some contact with persons inclined
to be pro-German. By way of explaining the additional
activities sometimes taken on by the League, the Chief
says: “This office worked with the Special Agents at
Jacksonville, and with officers of the Seventh Naval District.
We have also given information to the Collector of Internal
Revenue concerning those who should pay income tax. Our
division consisted of twenty-four members—all high-class
men who could be relied upon in any emergency that might
arise. We were taking steps to enlarge the organization
when the German balloon burst.”</p>

<p>Eustis, Florida, was more especially concerned with war
cases. Forty-one cases of draft delinquency were handled;
two slacker raids were conducted, and there was a little
“work or fight” activity. Eustis is in a county which
had the reputation of harboring a good many slackers and
deserters, who sought peace and quiet in some of the out-of-the-way
places. Through the activities of the local A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
division, this situation was cleared up distinctly. The Chief
says: “We believe we have been instrumental in protecting
many people from their own follies, and have brought
to justice men who were engaged in obstructing the Government’s
war activities in one part of the country or another.
It has been a pleasurable though arduous service that some
of us have rendered in this work.”</p>

<p>Kissimmee, Florida, reports: “All quiet along the Kissimmee.
Our community was singularly free of annoyance
of any character. Two or three persons were indiscreet in
their language, but we found that a small reminder was
sufficient to stop the talk.”</p>

<p class="center">
KENTUCKY
</p>

<p>Louisville, Kentucky, is a busy and famous old town with
a reputation for being engaged in the manufacture of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</span>
trouble-making products, but there seems to have been very
little trouble. Only eighty-nine cases of disloyalty and sedition
are reported, and 308 under the selective service regulations.</p>

<p>Mr. George T. Ragsdale, the first Chief of Louisville Division,
instructed his men to keep under cover, so that the
personnel of the division was very little known. More than
700 reports were made in all, and nine men were sent to
the penitentiary. Local business men furnished most of the
working capital. Upon Mr. Ragsdale’s resignation, Mr. J. V.
Norman was appointed Chief, taking over about 400 members.
The city was divided into nine districts and the
County in three, with the usual subdivisions of captains
and lieutenants as operatives. The membership was up to
about 700 at the time of the signing of the Armistice.</p>

<p>Most of the investigations handled by the Louisville Division
were on requests coming from local draft boards, although
the several branches of the government’s legal organization
frequently asked for aid. Several thousand men
were questioned in the slacker raid of August 3. Thirty-five
men were taken to jail and fourteen inducted; among these,
several deserters. Sometimes at a race track a quiet investigation
would be put on without any open raid.</p>

<p>Among the list of delinquents turned in was a man named
Lyle D. <span class="nowrap">B——</span>. An intercepted letter resulted in an
examination of the man’s mother, who refused to tell where
he was. Portland, Oregon, was suspected as his present residence.
The case came to an end when it was found that the
delinquent had been committed to the Federal penitentiary
at McNeil Island, Washington. His questionnaire was forwarded
by the local board to the penitentiary and returned
properly filled in. The man had a fairly good alibi. The
usual cases of religious fanatics, loud talkers and bearers
of false witness were uncovered in the League’s work. Many
of the best citizens of Louisville were engaged in these somewhat
undignified and often thankless tasks of ferreting out
such matters.</p>

<p>Lexington, Kentucky, as might easily be expected, reports
in American fashion: “The sentiment of our entire population
is hard against the Germans and their allies. Our people
are almost unanimous in their opposition to showing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</span>
Germany any consideration, even with furnishing them
food after their defeat. The one sentiment is that Germany
could feed herself while in war; now let her feed herself
since she is out of war.”</p>

<p>The work of the Lexington Division was mostly concerned
with the local and district boards. It handled 405 cases of
this sort. There were only thirty cases of disloyalty and
sedition investigated, and forty cases of word-of-mouth
propaganda.</p>

<p>Marion, Kentucky, says: “We are glad to report that
our county has been so patriotic that little of any importance
is required to be done. We had to caution a few of our citizens
as to the bad results of opposition to the United States
in the war. We have no foreign element. Our citizens come
from Virginia, Tennessee and North Carolina, and are of
old families. We rarely see anyone of foreign descent in
this section except traveling men who make trips through
the county.”</p>

<p>Somerset, Kentucky, had a bad man—a deserter who
escaped from Fort Oglethorpe once or twice, the last time
taking along his rifle and pistol. He barricaded himself in
an old house at Helenwood, Tennessee. The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. took
him all right, in spite of his threats. He is in Fort Leavenworth
for twenty years. From far off Livingston, Montana,
came a request to Somerset Division to arrest one Willie
McK——, a professional evader. He was found attending
church. The Chief says: “We walked in and gave him
a tap on the shoulder, and told him to come out. Just as
we started for the door, the choir began to sing, ‘God be
with you till we meet again.’ It is going to be some time.”
Somerset concludes: “We did not stop when the Armistice
was signed, but kept watching everything and giving the
Government the best that was in us!” Isn’t that fine?</p>

<p class="center">
TENNESSEE
</p>

<p>The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. work in the beautiful and historic old city
of Nashville was somewhat circumscribed because of the
activities of other agencies already in existence. The division
did its share in the routine work of war activities, apprehending
evaders, conducting numerous investigations, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</span>
vigilantly keeping tab on the comings and goings in the Old
Hickory Powder Plant.</p>

<p>Chattanooga, Tennessee, did its bit and did it well. Ten
prisoners who escaped from the local War Prison were apprehended
by division operatives, and brought back for reinternment.
One member of the division discovered an
extensive system of graft in connection with the Government
construction work on the Nitrate Plant at Sheffield, Ala.
Report of this was furnished to a Special Agent, who was
detailed by the Government to conduct an investigation.
The Chief comments: “Just what can be proven in this
case remains to be seen.”</p>

<p>Some of the most amusing Chattanooga investigations
were those of the religious sect known as the “Holy
Rollers.” Several of these preachers had preached sermons
in which they condemned the Red Cross and the Government
generally. These men were apprehended, and members of
their congregations testified at local headquarters. Some
of these preachers were moved by the “spirit” in their
testimony, but after they remained in jail a short time, they
saw the Scriptures in a different light, and very few of them
offended a second time.</p>

<p>Another Chattanooga case had in it the possibilities of
great mischief. A large amount of mail to an illiterate
mountaineer caused an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. operative and a Special
Agent of the Department of Justice to go to the top of Sand
Mountain, and in a dirty log cabin they found a wagon load
of I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. literature and correspondence in which were
letters from Emma Goldman and other leading lights of
socialistic faith. The man himself was working in a foundry
turning out Government orders; he was organizing a strike
at the time he was taken into custody.</p>

<p>Clarksville, Tennessee, is in the loyal Southern country,
and is very free from alien population. There were only
twenty-five investigations for disloyalty and sedition, and
propaganda was almost negligible. As this is the tobacco
producing section, there was considerable property investigated
under the Trading with the Enemy Act, and some
helpful reports were made to the Alien Property Custodian.
The League members were active in all the war work.</p>

<p>Hopkinsville, Tennessee, had a great deal of trouble over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</span>
illegal transportation of whiskey, a great deal of which went
to workers in government powder plants in an adjoining
city. “We arrested so many that no record was kept,”
says the Chief. Things became quieter later on.</p>

<p>Huntingdon, Tennessee, is another disgustingly quiet and
satisfied community. “People nearly all natives,” says the
report, “and mighty few expressions of disloyalty. We
have watched for violations, but nothing has developed
worthy of report.”</p>

<p class="center">
TEXAS
</p>

<p>San Antonio, Texas, is in a strongly pro-German neighborhood
and has a large citizenry of German descent. It is
refreshing nevertheless to see that in this good old Texas
town, once distinctly Spanish, the language of the United
States prevails to-day and only one flag floats over the
Alamo. There were thirty-four investigations for sedition,
and twenty-four cases of propaganda. The usual number
of overseas examinations were held. On the whole, San
Antonio seems to have been quiet and peaceful and distinctly
loyal in every way, in spite of her location so close to New
Braunfels.</p>

<p>The San Antonio Chief concludes his too brief report with
a little story:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The telephone at my elbow rang insistently. The man at
the other end of the wire was incoherent, and I could not
understand what he wanted.</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute!” I finally interrupted. “Who is this
speaking?”</p>

<p>He would not tell me; he merely said that he was a friend
of mine. I did not like to give information over the ’phone
when I was not sure as to whom I was talking. I again
insisted that he give me his name; once more he refused to
do so, reiterating that he was a good friend of mine. I could
not recognize the voice. But what he said was startling.</p>

<p>Recently I had been appointed Chief of the American Protective
League for this District, and how my informant had
learned, or guessed, that I was engaged in it, I could not tell.
I did not like to undertake a wild goose chase; at the same
time, if I should refuse to follow up the clue he gave me, the
lives of many might be endangered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</span></p>

<p>Anything could happen in San Antonio. It is one of the
oldest cities in the United States, and ever since the day the
Spaniard founded it, has been a hotbed of intrigue. Just
at this time there were fully twenty thousand troops stationed
in the various Camps about the City, and in order to impress
the Mexicans with the idea that we were not altogether helpless,
it had been suggested that a patriotic military parade be
given. This was to take place the following day, and I had
spent many hours helping to arrange the details. And now,
my mysterious “friend” had told me over the ’phone that he
knew certain parties were plotting to throw a bomb into the
parade; that if I would go to the certain house named by
him, I would find a meeting of the plotters in progress!</p>

<p>There was no time to be wasted. I got in touch with one
of my lieutenants, <span class="nowrap">M——</span>, and asked him to meet me in
half an hour, and to come armed. Before leaving the office
I sent for a couple of suits of overalls, one of which I donned,
and when I met <span class="nowrap">M——</span>, I gave him the other.</p>

<p>I told him all that I knew, and he realized that it was
serious. We parked our car about two blocks from the house
designated by my informant, and approached it afoot. The
neighborhood was questionable. The house to which I had
been directed stood a few feet back from the street in a neglected
tangle of shrubbery. There was a fence about the property,
but no gate. It was a small frame shack with two rooms
in front and a third forming an ell. We walked around it
cautiously several times, and finally discovered a light in the
ell. The blinds were all tightly closed, and it was but a faint
glimmer through a crack that we saw. We crawled carefully
to the gallery and each looked through the crack.</p>

<p>We could barely distinguish the forms of five men huddled
over an oil stove in the middle of the room. Three were in
overalls and had the appearance of laborers; one wore a
shabby old suit of civilian clothes, and the fifth appeared to
be in uniform. Their heads were close together and they
seemed to be talking in low tones, but neither <span class="nowrap">M——</span> nor I
could distinguish a word that was said.</p>

<p>There was a door a few feet from where we were, and I
noticed another one on the opposite side of the room. I told
M—— to go around to the other door and I would remain
where I was. If either of us was able to distinguish any suspicious
words, or if we found any reason to suspect that the
five men were actually plotting, a low whistle was to be the
signal to the other, and simultaneously we were to break in
the door and rush them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</span></p>

<p>While the whole thing had the appearance of a conspiracy,
and I was inclined to take the bull by the horns and give
M—— the agreed signal, I was also suspicious that someone
might be playing a practical joke on me. While I hesitated,
M—— suddenly sneezed!</p>

<p>I have lived in the Southwest the greater part of my life
and have been in some pretty tight places, and always have
prided myself on my ability to take care of myself in an
emergency; but the next thing I knew after <span class="nowrap">M——</span>’s sneeze,
he was bending over me trying to staunch the blood that was
flowing from a wound over my right eye, at the same time
reading the riot act to me in choice language.</p>

<p>“What happened?” I asked, feebly.</p>

<p>“Why, the whole darned shooting-match jumped your way,
walked over you and beat it!” he explained in exasperation.
“What I’ve been trying to find out is why in hell you didn’t
shoot?”</p>

<p>I could not answer in words, but mutely I showed him that
in my haste I carefully had put on the overalls over my clothes
with my gun in the usual place in my hip pocket. It would
have taken me five minutes to get it out.</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing you had it so well hid,” he remarked.
“They might have taken it away from you!”</p>

<p>We searched the deserted house. Except for the stove it was
devoid of furniture, and we found nothing in the way of
a clue.</p>

<p>We arranged for a strict patrol of the route of the parade.
Each man was given a “beat.” If any man saw anything
suspicious, and particularly a suspicious package, he was to
investigate and report at once.</p>

<p>The parade was crossing the Houston Street bridge, where
I happened to be, when I saw a negro man elbowing his way
to the front of the crowd along the curb. In his right hand,
held high over the heads of those about him, was a package
wrapped in newspaper! He seemed in the act of hurling it
into the street when I sprang forward and grabbed the upraised
arm, dragging the negro back to the railing of the
bridge.</p>

<p>“What have you got in that package?” I demanded.</p>

<p>“My Gawd, boss, you’se the fou’th man to ast me about ma
lunch in the last five minutes. If it’s worrying you white
folks so much, guess I’d better git shet of it!”</p>

<p>Before I could prevent him, he threw it into the river, and
turned to view the parade with a muttered opinion on my
interference with his personal liberties. All we succeeded in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</span>
accomplishing was scaring a poor negro out of his lunch,
but whether or not we thwarted others in a worse plot, we
never knew.</p>

<p>But that was much our story in San Antonio. We did the
best we knew. Had we not been there, and were it not known
that we were there, matters might have been worse. The
makings of trouble were around us all the time.</p>
</div>

<p>Laredo, Texas, on the Mexican border, was organized for
business. The Chief says: “We have very few alien
enemies resident here. Before we organized, there was
some talk of a disloyal nature, but this situation changed
at once when it got out that we had seventy-five or eighty
members whose identity was unknown to the public but who
would be pretty sure to be out for business. For the six or
eight months before the Armistice we heard scarcely a word
unfavorable to the United States or her Allies. We think we
did something in the way of prevention if not of cure.”</p>

<p>Yoakum, Texas, has ten cases of disloyalty and a like
number of word-of-mouth propaganda. A good local chief
of a fighting family says: “We were ready at all times to
meet any emergency regardless of distance or difficulty.”</p>

<p>Beaumont, Texas, is in the oil country, and such centers
quite often attract alien population. The Beaumont report
covers sixty-three cases of alien enemy activities, eighteen
cases of disloyalty, and ninety cases under the selective
service regulations.</p>

<p class="center">
ARKANSAS
</p>

<p>Cotter, Arkansas, reports that it is a community with
very few foreigners, the population being American for
generations back. The Chief says: “We had two deserters
who lived for two weeks in an inaccessible camp in the mountains.
They finally got hungry, came in and surrendered.
We also had one draft-dodging case of a peculiar sort. This
young man, according to his marriage license, should have
registered in June, 1917. He did not. We traced him to
Oklahoma, and from there to Springfield, Missouri. He
was taken into custody by the Chief of Police at that point
on our order. We sent a certified copy of his marriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</span>
license, but he had enough of his relatives on hand to swear
to his true age, to secure his release.”</p>

<p>Helena, Arkansas, also comes into court with very clean
hands. Its report shows a membership of 127, which proved
to be none too large, as all hands found work to do. Investigations
were handled all over Arkansas, Mississippi and
Louisiana.</p>

<p>Fort Smith, Arkansas, found its slacker raids more interesting
than anything else. It conducted two of them, a
slacker or two being apprehended each time. One stranger,
who was sufficiently indiscreet as to fail to register, was
unceremoniously hauled out of bed and turned over to the
local war board. No alien enemy activities came to the attention
of this division.</p>

<p class="center">
OKLAHOMA
</p>

<p>The State of Oklahoma does not submit a wealth of material
for this history of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L., and indeed the evidence
seems to indicate that there was comparatively little material
to submit. Chickasha, Oklahoma, sends in a little report,
covering three alien enemy investigations; four cases of disloyalty
and sedition; one case of sabotage; five cases of word-of-mouth
propaganda; two deserter cases, and seven character
and loyalty investigations.</p>

<p>There are numerous reports at hand, which are made in
the form of figures only, but it is impossible to print these in
detail.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>
THE STORY OF THE WEST</h3>

<p>Under the caption of The West, we arbitrarily are grouping
all of the states lying west of a line running north and
south from the western borders of the Dakotas to the eastern
edge of New Mexico. This excludes part of that great region
long known in America as the Great West,—a country that
is no more, and never again can be on the face of this earth,
unless war and pestilence one day shall quite remove our
present human population. What we retain as the West
for A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. classification purposes still has some distinct
characteristics. It still is largely unknown land to Eastern
citizens, still holds the flavor of a romantic past, as well as
that of a great and unknown future.</p>

<p>The region thus set off comprises more than a third of the
acreage of the United States. It is the most thinly settled
portion of the United States and, made up as it is in large
part of arid lands or mountainous regions, no doubt on the
average it always will remain so. Yet here lie the richest
remaining forests of America, and no one may know how
much of additional mineral wealth. Here also, our country
halts at the shore of the Pacific and looks westward at the
future. In the march of King Charles, his knights paused
at Rockfish Gap, and those merry gentlemen carelessly
claimed possession of all those unknown lands that lay to
the westward, “as far as the South Sea.” Well, we have
made the crossing of the continent. We are at the South
Sea now.</p>

<p>Who and what are we, however, who stand at the edge of
the Pacific and look westward? Are we Americans? Who
could call us such? We are not the same Homeric breed
now that we were when the first rails went west. Taking
our arbitrary section herein, west of the Dakotas, and
studying the statistical census map of the United States
made in 1914—the first year of the war—we find that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</span>
the population of Montana is more than fifty percent
foreign-born, or of foreign-born parentage. The same is
true of Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona, Nevada, Idaho,
California, Oregon and Washington; all have population
thirty-five to fifty percent foreign of birth or parentage!
This, in what we have thought was the American West!</p>

<p>There is no American West. There is no America. But
for the Grace of God, we are gone. This is no mere rant.
Study the census maps yourself—you can have no more
thrilling, no more fascinating and no more saddening reading,
search how you may. The trouble with most of us
Americans was that we did not know our America. For
America, this war is not over. It is just beginning. The
more we set aside preconceived notions or biased and
unctuous conclusions based on suppositions and not facts
for premises, and the more we learn the actual facts regarding
this country’s problems to-day, the more we shall be
obliged to that sobering and wholly distasteful thought that
America is at the threshold of her real war. That man
does not live who can with any color of authority predict
the end of that irrepressible conflict. No Statue of Liberty
can avert it; no jaunty melting pot doctrine can conjure it
away.</p>

<p>But the great West, which with the great South remains
in larger percent American than do the North or the East,
was zealously on guard throughout this war. Few of our
far-flung marches but had an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. outpost of Americans,
and these were eyes of the same sort that long ago looked
down the brown barrels of long rifles in the frontier days.
If we had a frontier now, here it would lie, between the
Prairies and the Pacific; and the frontier always has been
loyal. It was loyal in this war. The next great American
will come from the land of the old Frontier. What, think
you, will be his message? Will it be of melting-pots?</p>

<p class="center">
COLORADO
</p>

<p>Denver, Colorado, must have a rather thrifty population,
for there were 140 cases of food hoarding reported from
that division. Operatives of the League investigated 789
cases of disloyalty and sedition under the Espionage Act,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</span>
and the division as a whole worked in close coöperation with
the local draft boards. The Chief says: “We looked into
the German language situation; also vice, liquor, bootlegging,
and general lawlessness in coal mining camps. We
investigated the loyalty of many individuals who were under
consideration for membership in patriotic associations or
for City or State positions.”</p>

<p>Delta County, Colorado, had one simple and kindly pro-German
section foreman who left spikes sticking up in the
wagon road crossing, so that they might possibly destroy
some American tires. Very thoughtful, but not very damaging.
Apropos of one of the more lurid happenings in
this division, the Chief says: “We got a riot call to a small
settlement six miles out, and I responded with three details
of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. members. We arrived on the scene at 11:00
p. m. and found thirty armed Americans who were just starting
in to clean up a settlement of eleven German families.
We quieted things until we could make an investigation, and
then found that a poison scare was at the root of the trouble.
A German administered a pint bottle of bluing to one of his
sick horses. The horse very promptly died. Heated imagination
did the rest.” The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. certainly prevented bloodshed
in this instance.</p>

<p>Mancos, Colorado, gives a pleasant little touch of local
color: “Just a few days before war was declared with
Germany, one G. B. <span class="nowrap">B——</span>, a resident of Mancos, Colorado,
made some very derogatory remarks to the effect that
the war, if it was declared, would be a rich man’s war, for
the benefit of the wealthy class, and that the United States
had no business in war with Germany; that the American
flag would soon be dragged in the dust, and by the Germans,
if war were declared. His wife also stated that the Germans
had done nothing worse than the soldiers did in our late
civil war. Many remarks were made showing sympathy with
the German cause. When the news of the first big victory
of the Allied armies was received here, an impromptu celebration
was held on the streets of the town, and all of
doubtful sympathies were asked to mount a box and wave
an American flag. Some half a dozen did so, and did it
gracefully and with seeming willingness, but Mr. <span class="nowrap">B——</span>
refused to come out. Later, at another celebration, he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</span>
made to come out and wave the flag, though he did it with
bad grace and only upon being strenuously urged to do so.
He made a long talk trying to tell how loyal he was, but
he would not submit to waving the flag until really made to
do so, and then in a very insulting way. He made no more
violent utterances after the time mentioned.”</p>

<p>Red Cliff, Colorado, had at least one hectic moment: “On
October 14, 1918, the County Treasurer’s deputy, Mrs.
F——, deliberately tore down the Fourth Liberty Loan
poster, remarking that ‘That has been up there long enough;
it has almost ruined our flowers in the window.’ It was
developed that our County Treasurer, Mr. <span class="nowrap">C——</span>, was a
hoarder of food, and the local Food Administrator arrested
him and fined him $25 for the benefit of the Red Cross.
The County Treasurer called me into his office, caught me
by the throat and tried to scare me, saying: ‘I understand
you are showing a paper around here trying to ruin my
character; that you are saying that I am a dirty slacker.
Aren’t you ashamed of yourself to circulate such dirty lies
about me?’ Then the fun began. I struck him and told
him that if he was guilty of hoarding 2,000 pounds of flour
in his brother’s attic, he certainly was a dirty, low-down
slacker and traitor. He weighs about 225 pounds; I weigh
143. He threw me down and sat on me for fifteen minutes,
trying to make me apologize. I didn’t, and never will for
any man of pro-German type.”</p>

<p>For a man weighing only 143 pounds, the Red Cliff chief
seems to have been active. He sent back three Canadian
subjects and caused a decided change of heart in a pro-German
who was the son-in-law of a local banker. The
suspect got wind of the fact that he was being investigated,
and his conversion was very prompt, he making no attempt
to sit down on the local Chief.</p>

<p>Prowers County, Colorado, investigated fifty cases of
mouth-to-mouth propaganda, a notable case in its annals
being that of a German Lutheran minister who refused to
answer the question as to which side he wished to win the
war. It did not take him long, however, to realize that he
had made a blunder. He asked for time. The next day he
declared very promptly that he wanted the United States
to win. He was instructed to prove this by preaching and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</span>
praying it in private as well as in public, which he agreed
to do.</p>

<p class="center">
MONTANA
</p>

<p>Billings, Montana, organized its A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. division only
three months before the signing of the Armistice. The Chief
says: “It was a privilege to serve. We are grateful for
the opportunity that came to us. Our field was small, and
our time of service was short, but if we contributed in some
small way to the success of the League’s work, we feel amply
repaid.”</p>

<p>Red Lodge, Montana, is a coal mining town with a considerable
foreign element, so it early organized a “Liberty
Committee” of two hundred citizens. This committee
worked in with the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. The fact that a division of the
latter body was organized was not definitely known, but the
belief got out that the Government had a secret agency
working at Red Lodge and that it was in working order;
“which it was,” says the Chief.</p>

<p class="center">
NEW MEXICO
</p>

<p>An instance of shrewd detective work comes from Albuquerque,
New Mexico, whose Chief reports:</p>

<p>We received a copy of a letter mailed from this point
several months previous, illegibly signed, but clearly addressed
to a man named <span class="nowrap">H——</span> in Holland. The letter,
intercepted by censors, contained disloyal statements about
Liberty Bonds, and referred to “our bank.” We assumed
from this that the writer of this letter was a banker. The
use of blank paper instead of a business letterhead suggested
that he was a transient. Albuquerque being quite a
health resort, we surmised that the banker was probably a
well-to-do health seeker. Accordingly, we combed the higher
class resorts frequented by visitors of this type. Going
through the list of patrons at one of these places, we found
the name of A. <span class="nowrap">H——</span>, resident of an Arkansas town. By
referring to the bank directory, we discovered that this man
was a director and officer in the bank at that town. We sent
this information to the National Directors in Washington.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</span>
It was sufficient. The investigation of the whole case consumed
thirty minutes. We admit it was a little different
from the usual routine that we usually had to follow.</p>

<p class="center">
UTAH
</p>

<p>Green River, Utah, had a couple of cases which made some
trouble. One was that of William F. <span class="nowrap">A——</span>, and Callie
A——, his wife. Evidence was secured showing that this
man was not a citizen, although he had voted as such. It
was alleged that he was handling high explosives in violation
of the law and that he expressed disloyal sentiments.
Military Intelligence in Salt Lake confiscated the arms and
ammunition, and had <span class="nowrap">A——</span> registered as a German alien
enemy. His wife was very bitter in her denunciation of the
United States and the Red Cross. The son of the two was
charged with being a draft evader. Another man, James
H——, was alleged never to have registered for the draft,
although within the age limit. He was arrested, admitted
his guilt, and was turned over to the County Board.</p>

<p>Hiawatha, Utah, seems to have been for the most part
quiet during the war. This division says: “Due to the
loyal spirit of our people, our report is short. We are in a
thinly settled locality. We got only one fine imposed, a
violator of the food regulations, who pleaded guilty.”</p>

<p>Richfield, Utah, is a farming community off the railroad,
having no large labor organizations to make trouble. The
Chief says: “A few pro-Germans were quietly warned,
and that was all that was necessary. All our members were
organized and watchful, and there was not much to do. Any
service we could render we gladly gave.”</p>

<p>Santaquin, Utah, sends the best and most satisfactory
kind of a report: “I am proud to state that this little
town has been loyal to the core. We have not found a single
slacker or disloyal case. Investigated one or two cases of
men asking for military service and found them O.&nbsp;K. In
all the drives for bonds and thrift stamps, we have ‘gone
over the top,’ and we hope to continue with the same good
spirit and loyalty.”</p>

<p>Moab, Utah, has a local chief of a calm turn of mind. He
says that most of the talk he heard was just that of some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</span>
ignorant people who didn’t know the difference between war
and peace times. The Chief adds that he saw only three or
four parties who refused to buy bonds. “I had a talk with
them, and they bought willingly,” he adds!</p>

<p>From Fillmore, Utah, the Chief reports: “Not much to
do in this out-of-the-way place. We watched every person
who came into town. No telling when we might not have
been of service in apprehending some person badly needed.”</p>

<p>Smithfield, Utah, reports: “We had only twelve in our
organization. Our community is only two thousand—a
farming community of good quiet citizens. We support the
constitution; over-subscribed for Liberty Bonds, Red Cross,
and War Savings Stamps. If you realize what a rural
community like this is, you know there is not much to do.
We have done what we could with the local boards in draft
matters.”</p>

<p class="center">
ARIZONA
</p>

<p>Tucson, Arizona, is the land of sunshine and appears to
have been very peaceful. The Chief reports that there were
plenty of war activities going on all the time, but none of
these were of a nefarious sort. There apparently was nothing
wild or woolly about an A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. job in Tucson during
war times.</p>

<p>Cochise County, Arizona, was once somewhat famous for
loading up a railroad train with undesirable citizens and
then telling the engineer to steam ahead. None the less, this
last year or so Cochise has had absolute peace and quiet.
Ever so often, of course, a dissatisfied citizen would go over
to Mexico, subsist on red beans for a while, and then try to
get back. He would usually find the getting back a trifle
more difficult than the going over. About 1,000 investigations
were made, most of them referred to the Department
of Justice at Bisbee and Douglas. About forty-five or fifty
men of the live-wire type did the work. There was always
an element of danger present, though nothing ever broke.</p>

<p>Naco is directly on the border between Mexico and the
United States. Douglas, not far distinct, is a busy town of
which smelting is the big industry. The historic town of
Tombstone is the county seat. Bisbee is one of the largest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</span>
copper camps in the world. There were good men and true
with the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. in all of these towns, and they did fine,
loyal service for the flag.</p>

<p class="center">
WYOMING
</p>

<p>An artless report comes from Weston County, Wyoming:
“We had a number of people here who were pro-German,
but all such cases were quieted with a little assistance.
One man said that he was in hopes that he could eat another
good meal in his own country, Germany. When he got
through talking to all the people who waited upon him, he
went home and committed suicide.”</p>

<p>Moran, Wyoming, is hardly a place where you would look
for a Russian countess. None the less, Moran contained one
for a while, and A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. found her there and made certain
investigations. One I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. leader was also discovered
by alert operatives.</p>

<p>Sundance, Wyoming, is in the short grass country, and
reports but little German activity. Most of the work of this
division had to do with draft board matters. The ranch
country of the west was in a very large measure strictly
loyal, as the reports show.</p>

<p class="center">
IDAHO
</p>

<p>Idaho Falls, Idaho, had one case which again shows the
pronounced anti-Americanism of the German Lutheran
church in America during the war. C. C. <span class="nowrap">M——</span>, a minister
of this denomination located at Blackfoot, Idaho, applied
for the position of chaplain in the United States Army. The
local chief of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. investigated him and found him
to be violently pro-German. It was known that he had
threatened to blow up the town of Blackfoot with dynamite,
and had also made threats to poison the source of the water
supply of the town. Did Rev. Mr. <span class="nowrap">M——</span> get his chaplaincy?
He did not. A local applicant for the position of
Captain in the United States Army, as Inspector of Arms,
was also investigated, and was turned down on account of
his strong pro-German tendencies.</p>

<p>Almo, Idaho, reports: “Our locality is wholly a stock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</span>
raising section and is sparsely settled, so there has been no
disloyalty or trouble whatsoever. There is nothing to report
except that the people of this section are absolutely O.&nbsp;K.
in their loyalty to Uncle Sam.”</p>

<p class="center">
CALIFORNIA
</p>

<p>Long Beach, California, sends in a two-page report which
is entirely too modest, because it covers 8,590 investigations.
Out of this number, ninety were held in the Federal courts.
Twenty were convicted, and three were found not guilty.
Forty slackers and deserters were arrested, and three alien
enemies, who were taken in the shipyards, were interned.
Some 3,000 persons who had made indiscreet remarks against
the country were warned to good effect.</p>

<p>In the Long Beach district were four shipbuilding plants.
It was learned that several I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.’s were numbered among
the employees. They were taken from the shipyards for
cause. The Long Beach chief was reluctant to disband, and
when the time came to do so, he made arrangements by which
the division will be held as a sort of reserve. “If at any
future time you need our assistance,” says the Chief, “you
will find us waiting.”</p>

<p>Oakland, California, looked into the color of the hair and
eyes of 387 persons under the heading of disloyalty and
sedition. There were 356 investigations under the draft act.
Oakland Division dealt out its punishments to the enemy
drastically. Seventeen well-known local Germans, business
and professional men, drank a toast to the Kaiser in the
Faust Café, a German restaurant. The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. got the
necessary evidence, and ten of these men were convicted of
disloyalty. The court put the punishment at three months
in the chain gang, and a fine of $250 each. They do not
now know any such phrase as “Hoch der Kaiser.”</p>

<p>Crescent City, California, had at least one high light.
The Chief reports that an enemy alien, a baker, learned in
some way that his loyalty had been questioned, and immediately
started to gather all the rifles and pistols that he
could, declaring that with a dozen guns he could hold the
whole town at bay. Officers searched his place of business
during his absence, and found several of the guns loaded.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</span>
The man claimed to be a naturalized citizen, but could not
show his papers. His case was cared for.</p>

<p class="center">
OREGON
</p>

<p>The far Northwest bordering on the sea caught flotsam
and jetsam, caught problems, as seaboard regions always
have and always will. The city of Portland, Oregon, shares
in these matters, though it is old, settled, and much disposed
to quiet. Portland’s main concern in life is the growing of
roses; but early in the war Portland had already thrown
away her rose-growers’ club and set her hand to the ax
rather than to the garden trowel. As a city, it is a good
place for roses, but a poor place for alien enemies.</p>

<p>A certain man of many aliases, whom we may indicate
as <span class="nowrap">D——</span>, was arrested for being found within half a
mile of the Armory without an enemy permit. He was
found to be the owner of a great deal of I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. literature.
Investigation proved him to be a man of vitriolic temper, and
one possessed of considerable means. He was very well
investigated and jolly well interned.</p>

<p>A man by the name of <span class="nowrap">F——</span> was arrested as a German
alien, traveling without a pass. Very naturally, he claimed
to be a Swiss, as do all German waiters. Investigation of
his case proved he was in the habit of signing as a seaman,
on ships about to sail, and then refusing to go on board
at sailing time. His peculiar conduct got him in wrong with
the Sailors’ Union. A close examination developed that he
was a former German naval officer, and pictures of him were
found in the German uniform. He was interned as a dangerous
alien.</p>

<p>If Portland’s A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. could not get a man one way, there
were always other ways available. One J. <span class="nowrap">B——</span>, placed
under suspicion by the angry accusation of a woman whom
he claimed to be his wife, was discovered to be a draft
evader from Chicago. It was found also that he had a
real wife living in Oklahoma. The pretending wife forged
the wife’s name to the man’s questionnaire, thus securing
for him a deferred classification. He was indicted for violation
of the Mann Act and Conscription Act, and got eleven
months in jail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</span></p>

<p>The first slacker convicted and sentenced for violation of
the Conscription Act in the State of Oregon was C. <span class="nowrap">B——</span>
of Portland, who was discovered to have failed to register.
He was arrested the 10th of July, 1917, tried and convicted
and served thereafter as an example.</p>

<p>The hundreds of cases in Portland were of much the same
sort as those arising in other cities. The law of averages
held good. Once in a while a man was reformed, and once
in a while a flivver was found. E. <span class="nowrap">B——</span>, of California,
registered at Fairfield, California, June 5, 1918, was posted
as a deserter and arrested by an operative of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
at Portland, Oregon. He was of Swedish descent, and the
hearing of his case developed that many of his friends had
told him that he could get out of the Army by claiming
exemption as an alien subject to deportation. It was explained
to him that if he went back to Sweden under deportation,
he could never again return to the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> as a citizen.
This cleared up his mind distinctly, and he resolved to go
into the Army and will probably make a good citizen.</p>

<p>Canyon City, Oregon, says: “We had one man who was
constantly spilling over in favor of Germany. Our members
took him over the jumps and made him subside. He
could have been convicted, but neighbors promised to be
responsible for him, and they kept their word. Our people
as a whole were very loyal, and we had only a small number
of cases to handle.”</p>

<p class="center">
WASHINGTON
</p>

<p>Yakima, Washington, tabulates its activities as 93 cases
of disloyalty and sedition, ten cases of word-of-mouth
propaganda and sixteen I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. cases, besides the usual
routine work.</p>

<p>Snohomish, Washington, sends in a report indicative of
an unexpected amount of activity. There were 302 cases
of disloyalty and sedition, nineteen of sabotage, twenty-four
of anti-military activity, fifteen of propaganda, as well as
116 cases under the selective service regulations, and 124
under the “work or fight” order. The Chief closes his
modest summary with the statement that the work was
largely connected with I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. and Socialists activities
such as were noted in the Northwest during the war. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</span>
says: “We had the state secretary of the Socialists in the
penitentiary. Many I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.’s were jailed, and many more
were inducted into the Army. Some of the latter tribe have
been court-martialed since entering the Army.” As it were,
and so to speak, Atta Boy!</p>

<p class="center">
ALASKA
</p>

<p>And now let us give, as the very last tribute of The Four
Winds, the report of a town which may seem a long way
from home to many readers, but which, out of all the many
hereinbefore mentioned, will show best of all the far-flung
activities of the American Protective League. This report
comes from Anchorage, Alaska. Leopold David is Chief
at this far off station, and every word that he has written
shall go to the readers of the League:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Members of the League have been active in Red Cross work
here, in food conservation, and in the sale of Liberty Bonds
and War Savings Stamps. From the moment the Anchorage
branch was first organized, I impressed upon the members the
necessity of counter-propaganda to refute any insinuations
or charges that they might hear against the causes leading
the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> into war, and the conduct thereof. Everything in
connection therewith which was derogatory to the interests
of the <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> was immediately traced to its source, if possible,
and the false impression corrected. We have a large foreign
element here employed in railroad construction, and members
of the League made it a point in their trips up and down the
line to explain the reasons for all restrictions.</p>

<p>When a strike was threatened on the Government railroad
last year, members of the League explained to the men the
necessity of staying at work until their case could be decided,
so as not to interfere with the development of the coal fields
to which the road was being built, as coal was a war necessity.
I believe that such action by the League was in large measure
responsible for avoiding a strike.</p>

<p>Members of the League were on all committees in connection
with war work activities, as well as on the Territorial
Council of Defense, of which the Chief of the Anchorage
branch acted as Chairman. During the time the League was
organized, every member did his best for the interests of the
country, and no need arose for disciplining any member. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</span>
work of the League was carried on in such an unostentatious
manner that very few people knew of its existence except
the members.</p>
</div>

<p>It has a safe and significant sound—the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. at
Anchorage. Not a large place, indeed, but there were seven
cases of alien enemy activity, twenty-eight of disloyalty and
sedition, five of anti-military activities and thirty-two of
propaganda, beside two I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. investigations. Anchorage
seems to have been uncertain whether to work or fight in
some instances; 206 cases came up of this sort. In addition
to these, 143 draft cases came before the local boards, as
well as 62 slacker cases. Twenty-two cases under the head
of liquor, vice and prostitution were disposed of. The Food
Administration had only four cases. It is gratifying to note
that every head and sub-head of the report is filled out conscientiously
and carefully.</p>

<p>We may now cease the reading of further reports from
the four points of the compass in America, and rest with
this one from Anchorage, submitting once more the conviction
that these many varying reports, covering multifold
lines of investigation, make the best and truest reflex of
America ever gotten together in printed form. The reading
and summarizing of the reports made an extraordinary
experience, such as can hardly have come to many individuals,
probably to none outside of the Department of
Justice; and it is not known whether a similar enterprise
ever has been undertaken even in that great office. By no
means is it to be supposed that all the reports sent in have
been mentioned in these pages—only a small fraction have
had even the briefest mention. Many hundreds remain
unnamed in public as do hundreds of thousands of men who
made them up, not asking recognition for their work. It
would be cheap to thank such men, or to apologize to them.
In A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L., each of us has done the best he knew. For that,
there is higher and better approval than that of any printed
page.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Our Duty to the Soldier—Our Lasting Quarrel With the
Foe—The Story of the Census—No More Traitors—Shutting
the Gates Against the Huns—The New Patriotism
for All Americans.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Vox populi, vox dei</i> is a fine phrase. But fine phrases
often half-state or mis-state facts for sake of the half-idea’s
sound. Many popular conceptions are wide of the truth.</p>

<p>The world had come to call the French people light, fickle,
inconstant, volatile, incapable of grave and deep emotions.
That was the popular American idea of France up to 1914.
The man who would voice that idea now would be treated
with anger or silent contempt by all the world. Now we
know the silent, modest, simple, enduring faith, the unfaltering
courage, the undying flame of heart which made
the real France.</p>

<p>We thought Great Britain cold, phlegmatic, emotionless.
Who would say that to-day of a brave and strong people
trying their best to ask us not to mention their battles
against odds, their steadfast courage in holding the line,
but to feel and understand the real admiration and love
Britain really feels for us in these days.</p>

<p>We Americans thought ourselves above fickleness and
lightness always, boasted always of our common sense and
steady practical point of view. We called France hysterical.
Was it so? No. Once again popular counsel is wrong. It is
we Americans who are the most hysterical people in the
world. We make a purpose and forget it. We erect a hero
and forget him. We believe, boast, acclaim, hurrah—and
forget. We are easily excited—it is we who most easily grow
“high headed,” as the French say. It is we, of all nations,
who most quickly forget.</p>

<p>In that fact regarding the American character lies the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</span>
great hope of Germany to-day. It is the great fear of our
gallant friends in arms, who held the line from which we so
long were absent. It is the great danger of America. Lest
we forget! Lest we forget! The danger is that we shall forget.
And if we do, the great victory of this war is lost.</p>

<p>Our Army is turned back toward home again. We greet
our soldiers with much blare of trumpets. We mention large
plans of industry for to-morrow. We slap each man in
uniform on the back and say: “Fine! Noble! You are a
hero! You have saved the world!”</p>

<p>But to-morrow—To-morrow! And once more, what of
to-morrow!</p>

<p>The soldier comes back to his old world shyly glad that
he still lives, hoping for the renewed touch of hands he
knew, seeking the place in life that once was his. But, in spite
of our protestations, that place is no longer his. It is as
though he really were dead. The waters have closed over
his place and he is no more. To-morrow he is forgotten—and
he may listen to stay-at-home stories of how the war
was fought and won—the “history” of this war, which,
like all other history, will not be the truth but what we all
accept as the truth because that is the easiest thing to do.</p>

<p>But if the soldiers of this country are to come back only
to the old America, the hurrying, scrambling, hectic, hysterical
America—and those are our deserved adjectives
more than any other people’s—then we have not won this
war but have lost it.</p>

<p>Our quarrel with yonder foe is not done. We shall have
been faithless to our own blood and kin if now we forget.
The war begins now; not ends. It must yet be fought out
here at home in America. It will require all our courage to
win it; if indeed it can still be won.</p>

<p>There have been some great editorials struck off in the
white heat of American conviction in these tremendous days
following the Armistice and before the conclusion of the
Peace Conference. Here is one from a Chicago journal
which ought to be read and remembered by every statesman
and every citizen in America.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Those sentimental souls who think Lloyd George and Clemenceau
are “too severe” in insisting that Germany must pay to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</span>
the limit of her capacity for the damage she has wrought,
should consider the speech in which Herr Ebert, temporary
dictator in Berlin, welcomed the returning Prussian troops,
especially the following paragraph of that speech:</p>

<p><i>You protected the homeland from invasion, sheltered your
wives, children and parents from flames and slaughter and
preserved the nation’s workshops and fields from devastation.</i></p>

<p>This to the soldiers whose bestiality has made the very name
of Prussia a stench in the nostrils of a decent world.</p>

<p>There is not in Ebert’s speech a hint of repentance for the
atrocious crimes which Germany has committed. There is no
recognition that Germany has committed crimes. Instead,
there is a boasting glorification of the returning armies, and
a reminder to the nation that German lands have been kept
inviolate. It is one in sentiment with the kaiser’s speech six
months or so ago, in which he commanded his subjects who
complained of their sacrifices to look at the devastated fields
and cities of France, and see what war on their own ground
would mean.</p>

<p>The victorious allies are civilized. Therefore, they can not
repay German crimes in kind. They can not reduce Frankfort
to the present condition of Lens, or desolate the Rheingau
as von Hindenburg desolated Picardy. But in some way, they
must bring home to the German people both the villainy and
the failure of the German spring at the throat of Europe, and
there seem to be but two methods of doing this. One is to
inflict personal punishment on the men responsible for the
grosser outrages, and the other is to make the German people
pay, and pay, and pay for the ruin which they wrought.</p>
</div>

<p>Germany is not dead or defeated in America. She will
raise her head again. Again we shall hear the stirring in
the leaves, and see arise once more the fanged front which
has so long menaced the world. The time to scotch that
snake is now, to-day; and this is no time, when our maimed
men are coming home, when our young boys are growing up,
to be faithless to those men who—their eyes still on us as
they fling to us the torch of civilization—lie not yet content
nor quiet in Flanders Fields.</p>

<p>The great debt of the world is by no means yet paid.
Whether or not Germany pays to the material limit, is not
so much. Whether or not we get back a tenth of our war
money, is not so much—that is not the way the great debt
of the world is going to be paid. We cannot pay it by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</span>
oratory or by fine phrases, or by resolutions and conferences
and leagues of nations. We cannot pay it with eulogies of
the dead nor monuments to the living heroes. We cannot
pay it by advancing our breasts again against shot and shell.</p>

<p>The debt of the world must be paid by America. We
can pay it only by making a new and better democracy in
America. We can pay it only by renewed individual sacrifices
and a renewed individual courage.</p>

<p>We must remake America. We must purify the source of
America’s population and keep it pure. We must rebuild
our whole theory of citizenship in America. We must care
more for the safety of America’s homes and the safety of
the American ideal. We must insist that there shall be an
American loyalty, brooking no amendment or qualification.</p>

<p>That is to say, we must unify the American populace—or
we must fail; and the great debt of the world must remain
unpaid; and the war must have been fought in vain.</p>

<p>The old polyglot, hubbub, hurdy-gurdy days of America
are gone. We are no longer a mining camp, but a country,
or should be that. Happy-go-lucky times are done for us.
We must become a nation, mature, of one purpose, resolved
at heart. Now we shall see how brave we really
are, how much men we are.</p>

<p>What is America to-day? What undiscovered soul was
there lying under the paint and the high heels and the
tambourine and the bubbling glass in the fool’s paradise of
our excited lives? What was there of sober and resolved
citizenship under the American Protective League—a force
so soon developed, so silently disbanded? Very much was
there. All that a nation needs was there—if that nation
shall not forget.</p>

<p>It is one thing if a quarter million men go back to business
and forget their two years of sacrifice; if three million
soldiers also forget their sacrifices and simply drop back into
the old business world which they left. But it is quite another
thing if three and a quarter million American citizens,
sobered and not forgetful, do take up the flung torch and
say that the dead of Flanders shall rest content—not
merely for a day or so remembered—not merely for a year
or two revenged, but for all the centuries verified and made
of worth and justified in their sacrifices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</span></p>

<p>A part, only a small part, of the work of the American
Protective League is done. We who silently pass back yet
further beyond recognition, are not disbanded at all. The
flung torch is especially in our own hands. We have been
only pretenders in this League, we have been only mummers
and imposters in this League, if we do not individually carry
on the work for the future. That work, as we take it, is to
make America safe for Americans, and to leave each man
safe in his own home, in a country of his own making, at a
table of his own choosing.</p>

<p>When work on this book was first begun, it seemed to all
concerned that the great matter was to accumulate instances
of shrewdness in catching criminals; stories of plots foiled
and villains thwarted. We all of us wanted to see stalk by
with folded arms a tall, dark, mysterious stranger in a long
cloak, with high boots, and a wide hat pulled low over his
brow. We wanted him, in the final act, to pull off his hat
with the sweeping gesture of one hand, his false moustache
with the other, and stand revealed before us, smooth-faced
and fair of hair, exclaiming “It is I—Clarence Hawkshaw,
the young detective!” We shared the American thirst for
something exciting.</p>

<p>It became obvious, as the great masses of sober, conscientious
revelations from the very heart of America came rolling
in and piling up in cumulative testimony, that what had
at first seemed the most desirable material was the least
desirable. If this record is to have any ultimate value—and
it should have great historical value—that must be,
not because of a few flashy deeds, but because of a great,
sober, underlying purpose. Our final figure of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L.
man is not to be a Hawkshaw, but—an American.</p>

<p>When the time came to call a halt and to disband, there
was not a member of the League who did not lay down his
work sober and grave of heart. The sum of the reaction of
all these reports, large and small, from the hundreds of
centers where the League was active, leaves any man acquainted
with the facts convinced that America has done
her part splendidly, here at home, in the war. It is splendid—what
America has done. Far more splendid, what
America is. Still more splendid, what America is to be.</p>

<p>The best reading for any American in these days is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</span>
census map of the United States. Next year we shall have
a new one, for by then, ten years more of our history will
have been completed. The census map comes out once every
decade, printed in different colors, showing the location of
the foreign-born in the United States. The American-born
regions have appeared in steadily lessening areas as the
decades have passed.</p>

<p>It is only with a grave heart that any real American can
face the census map to-day. The conviction is inevitable
that we have been too long careless of our racial problems.
If we are to have an America now, we must change. Our
golden age of money-making is not a double decade in extent.
We cannot go that road another twenty years. If your son
is meant to be an American, have him study the census map
and the story of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. Then he will learn something
about his own country. He has not known. His father has
not known.</p>

<p>The English came early in our history and the Scotch-Irish,
the finest of frontier stock. The Pennsylvania Dutch
came and built homes. Then came the Irish, facile and quick
to blend. Our immigration before the Civil War was north-European—sturdy
stock, fit for the forests and prairies
and the vast new farm lands of the West. Now we began to
mine and manufacture more, and our immigrants changed
the colors of the census map. We began to import work
cattle, not citizens, for our so-called industrial captains.
Steamship companies combed southern and southeastern
Europe. Our miners could not speak English. The Irishman
worked no more on the railroads, the sewers, the
streets—he shrank from the squat foreigner as the lean
Yankee shrank from him—as the Italian, in turn, will
shrink from the Russian bolshevist, if we allow him to
swarm in.</p>

<p>The map shows you all these things inexorably. It shows
the shrinking of the American-born regions to-day to only
a small spot on the tops of the Cumberlands in Kentucky,
Tennessee, North Carolina and a corner of Alabama and
Georgia. Now check up this rough census outline with the
reports printed in these pages from all over America. We
soberly must conclude that America is not America. We
find that the great states of each coast are practically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</span>
foreign—New York most of all; that the Bolsheviki abound
in the mines of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Montana, where
coal and copper and iron are found; that Southern Europe
has not yet moved its center of population west of the Mississippi;
that the Scandinavian and German element occupies
Wisconsin, Minnesota and parts of upper Iowa. And
the American—where is he?</p>

<p>Would to God that the chameleon record, that fatally
accurate census map, could show us the American hue
spreading decade after decade, and not these other colors of
the map of America, showing the extension of the foreign-born!
It is time now, old as we are, that we should seek a
far more normal balance of the increase of our foreign-born.</p>

<p>Something is wrong. The census map shows that it is
time to put up the bars at Ellis Island. They ought to go
up for ten years at least. Twenty—thirty—lo! Then
this would be America, and all inside our gates would be
Americans. The gates ought never to go down as they have
in the past. We ought to pick and select our foreign-born
population. If we have not the courage to do that, we
are lost.</p>

<p>Give us a generation of selected immigration; deport the
un-Americans who divide their loyalty; revoke the naturalization
of every man interned in this war and of every other
disloyal man,—every adherent to the law of violence and
destruction,—and then, and then only, the result may be
an American population and a real America.</p>

<p>The best possible news for America would be that of the
deportation of more than 300,000 false and foresworn citizens
who have acted as German spies in America during
this war. Send that many away from America, and those
remaining soon would learn that the hyphen must go for
all time. If not, let them also go. We do not need Germans
now. The world is done with Germans. We want Americans
now.</p>

<p>It is by no means impossible that some such action will
be taken very soon. In his last annual report, the Attorney
General of the United States recommends that all aliens
who were interned during the war should be deported and
that Congress shall pass a law to that effect. This would
deprive us at once of a select society, estimated to number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</span>
from 3,000 to 6,000, who have been taking their ease in
their inn at our expense. Banded or disbanded, when the
American Protective League says that law must be passed,
it will be passed. And then we shall begin to have an
America and not a mining camp with open doors. Hunt out
Americans for your leaders. Vote for them. Where have
we ever found better leaders?</p>

<p>The Department of Justice officials are on record to the
effect that these interned aliens should not be left in this
country to make future trouble and to serve actively as
German agents. They were often trained propagandists;
men involved in bomb plots; men who plotted against our
shipping, against the transportation of our troops. We
have no law by which we can punish those men further.
Are they good citizens to retain? Our Department of Justice
thinks not.</p>

<p>Among these interned prisoners are bank presidents, exporters
and importers, college professors, merchants, musicians,
actors, former officers of the German army and navy
and merchant marine. Many of the names which have appeared
in the testimony of the Senate Overman Committee
appear also on the internment rolls. There are consuls,
officials and noblemen, so-called, who also have been in our
internment camps. Do we want them in our homes? The
Department of Justice thinks otherwise.</p>

<p>Not less disloyal than these greater figures are thousands
and hundreds of thousands of minor figures, paid or unpaid
propagandists of Germany in this country during the war,
pro-Germans, hyphenates, silent or outspoken, who are not
Americans at all. Do we want them in our citizenship? If
we cannot get rid of them, ought we to import any more
of them?</p>

<p>Already Americans stir uneasily under the revelations of
treachery within our gates. They ask of themselves,—Since
these things were true but now, what guarantee have we for
the future? How can America protect herself against the
future treachery of so large an element of her population?</p>

<p>The answer to that question is very easy for bold men.
Let us clean house. If the existing broom is not sufficient
for that, let us make another broom. The revocation of
citizenship for acts of disloyalty to this country is a remedial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</span>
agency which will be applied more frequently in the
future. A law should be, and probably will be, placed upon
our statute books which will hold over the head of every
foreign-born citizen attaining citizenship in this country a
warning that he must come into this court with clean hands
and must keep his hands clean forever thereafter. That is
to say, there shall be no more an absolute patent of citizenship,
nothing irrevocable any more in the citizenship of the
foreign-born. We will hold a first mortgage—we will give
him no deed. Four years ago, doctrine like this would have
been scouted. Four years hence it will be accepted, perhaps,
as the truth; indeed, the tendency has already begun. In
eight years it will be a law. In twenty years, America will
be a nation, and the strongest on the globe.</p>

<p>In New Jersey, Frederick Würsterbarth, who had a certificate
of American citizenship, perjured himself and remained
true to his foreign birth. He declared he would do
nothing to help defeat Germany, and had no desire to see
America win. He would not contribute to the Red Cross or
to the Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A. He added the old hyphenated plea that
to support the war against Germany would be like kicking
his mother in the face. The Federal courts canceled the certificate
of citizenship of Würsterbarth. In the New Jersey
case, the judge said of Würsterbarth: “Before he could
be admitted to citizenship, he must declare under oath that
he would support the Constitution of the United States and
entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to
any foreign sovereignty. Public policy requires that no one
shall be naturalized except he exercise the utmost good faith
in all the essentials required of him; and where the government
is shown that good faith in any of the essentials is
questionable, the burden must be on the respondent to dispel
that doubt.”</p>

<p>In addition to the statute which shall make false citizenship
papers revocable, little doubt exists that we also shall
have a law requiring the immediate deportation of any foreigner
who has failed to take out his second naturalization
papers within the prescribed time. The A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. investigations
during this war uncovered countless cases of these
pseudo-citizens. Of what use can any Monroe doctrine be
to America if it is our constant practice to nullify that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</span>
doctrine and stultify ourselves by allowing practical colonization?
And if you do not believe that we have foreign
colonies, study your census map and the history of the
American Protective League.</p>

<p>Is it bitter, such a belief? You think we still need the
German language in the United States? One hundred and
forty-two Illinois schools eliminated the study of German
from their curriculums during the last year, while twenty
schools reduced the courses offered in that subject. Ninety-six
schools introduced the study of French for the first time
and twenty-one schools added it to their curriculum in that
one state.</p>

<p>You still think this is rabid? Read from the report of
the Secretary of the Interior of the United States.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is even a larger problem than this that challenges
our attention, and that is the teaching of the English tongue
to millions of our population. Dr. John H. Finley, president
of the University of the State of New York, in a recent speech
presented this picture which he found in one of the cantonments:</p>

<p>“How practical is the need of a language in this country
common to all tongues is illustrated by what I saw in one of
the great cantonments a few nights ago. In the mess hall,
where I had sat an hour before with a company of the men
of the National Army, a few small groups were gathered along
the tables learning English under the tuition of some of their
comrades, one of whom had been a district supervisor in a
neighboring State and another a theological student. In one
of those groups, one of the exercises for the evening consisted
in practicing the challenge when on sentry duty. Each pupil
of the group (there were four of Italian and two of Slavic
birth) shouldered in turn the long-handled stove shovel and
aimed it at the teacher, who ran along the side of the room,
as if to evade the guard. The pupil called out in broken
speech, ‘Halt! who goes there?’ The answer came from the
teacher, ‘Friend,’ And then, <i>in as yet unintelligible English</i>
(the voices of innumerable ancestors struggling in their
throats to pronounce it), the words ‘Advance and give the
countersign.’ So are those of confused tongues learning to
speak the language of the land they have been summoned to
defend. What a commentary upon our educational shortcomings
that in the days of peace we had not taught these men,
who have been here long enough to be citizens (and tens of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</span>
thousands of their brothers with them), to know the language
in which our history and laws are written and in which the
commands of defense must now be given! May the end of this
decade, though so near, find every citizen of our State prepared
to challenge, in one tongue and heart, the purposes of all who
come, with the cry, ‘Who goes there?’”</p>
</div>

<p>Who are you, new man at Ellis Island? Are you a demobilized
German soldier looking for easy money in America?
Let us see your hands. <i>Qui vive!</i> Advance, and give
the countersign! And don’t let it be in German.</p>

<p>What all the world is fearing to-day is the growth of
Bolshevism. It has ruined Russia—and we must pay for
that; it is blocking the peace parliaments in Germany—and
we must pay for that. It is beginning in America and
may grow swiftly in the turbulent days after the war—and
we shall have to pay for that. Nobody knows what the
Bolshevist is nor what are the tenets of Bolshevism—least of
all the Bolshevists themselves. They have recruited their
ranks from the most ignorant and most reckless—from the
dregs and scum of the world. Their theory is that of force;
of government they have nothing. They use the force of
law without any surrender of privileges to the law. Their
theory of life is self-contradictory. None the less, since
they cannot be reasoned with, they constitute a menace to
any country. The mischief makers of all classes make recruits
for Bolsheviki—socialists, radical I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.’s, anarchists,
the red flag rabble of every country united in the
general ignorant greed of the wolf pack.</p>

<p>Bolshevism may come to America through the Socialists,
through the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. or through the Non-Partisan League—which
in the State of North Dakota to-day hold a two-thirds
majority of both House and Senate. It will grow out of the
ignorant and discontented foreigners unassimilated in this
country. We must expect it naturally to come from these
and from the pro-Germans in this country, because those
people never have been satisfied with what we did in the
war. In general, Bolshevism lives only on its own excitement,
its own lack of plans, its own eccentricities. It finds
its opportunity in any time of unrest and of slackened
government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</span></p>

<p>We have troublesome days of reconstruction ahead in
America. Food prices and wages cannot go up forever,
but it will be difficult to reduce wages and food prices. We
shall have unemployment in this country. We shall have
soldiers in this country dissatisfied because they find themselves
and their deeds so soon forgotten. These things all
are among the menaces of America, and they must be faced.
It will require a united America to face them successfully.</p>

<p>Shall we import more such problems, or shall we dispense
with certain of those which we now have? Besides all this
irresponsible and sporadic Bolshevik propaganda, we may
count upon the old, steady, undying, well-conceived and
well-spread propaganda of Germany after the war as much
as before and during the war. We shall meet—indeed, this
very day are meeting—propaganda against the Allies intended
to split us from France and Great Britain. Germany
is going out after her lost markets all over the world
as best she can. She will need all of her propaganda to
help her crawl back even into a place in the shadows of
the world and not in the sun of the world’s respect. While
the war was going on, some firm in America bought a shipload
of German toys. Who wants such blood-reddened toys
in his home? Soon we shall see German goods in our markets.
Who wants such goods? Soon we shall hear the
subtle commercial scoff, “It’s all bosh to refuse German
goods, for they are better and cheaper.” Is it so? Is it
our duty to be unsentimental in business? Germany was
quite unsentimental when she tore up the Belgian scrap of
paper. It now would seem to be time that we had some
sentiment of the old sort. Sentiment rarely is fundamentally
wrong. So-called common sense quite often is no more
than common selfishness.</p>

<p>As these pages go forward, the Allies’ declaration is that
the Hun shall not be allowed in the peace conference nor
in any League of Nations whatever that may be drawn up.
One thing is sure. No League of Nations ever will be
stronger than the individual thought of the countries combining.
Our League of Nations will be no stronger than
our feelings against pro-Germanism. If we forget that, and
take up the game at the old place, our League of Nations
is dead at its birth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</span></p>

<p>The Department of Justice, having removed restrictions
on enemy aliens, and having wiped out the barred zones
and the necessity of passes or permits, has released a great
many pro-Germans who will slip back into their old places
in America. In Great Britain the German waiter—so frequently
the German spy—is not going to be allowed to take
his old place. It may cause some inconvenience, but Great
Britain is going to get on without him. That is what we
must learn in America—to get on without some of the
stolid or the obsequious labor that we have had. With the
barring of alien labor, we should suffer many inconveniences
in our personal lives. If we cannot endure those inconveniences,
then we can have no League of Nations. With
the refusal to buy any article made in Germany, we should
be letting ourselves in for a considerable individual loss.
Unless we are willing to accept that loss, we can have neither
a League of Nations nor an America worthy of the name.</p>

<p>Germany is crippled, but not beaten and not repentant.
The Germans regret the sinking of the Lusitania only because
it was the thing which brought America into the war.
For the war itself they are not sorry. If defeat did not
make them repentant, heavy indemnities may help teach them
something of their real place in the world. That lesson will
be all the stronger if we in America shall make more stringent
importation and deportation laws—if we shall deport more
Germans and import less German goods. There is many and
many an American home where German goods never again
will enter the doors.</p>

<p>Prince Carl, of the House of Hohenzollern, when speaking
of the war, said he thought that Germany ought not to have
started her submarine warfare “without being absolutely
sure it would succeed.” He said he regretted the German
propaganda in the United States—because it had been carried
out so clumsily; he said that Germany ought to have
started her propaganda here on a larger scale, and ought
to have spent millions of marks instead of thousands! There
you see the German idea and part of the German policy in
America. They have learned some lessons, but not the great
lesson of the humble and the contrite heart.</p>

<p>Maximilian Harden has been a voice crying in the Hun
wilderness for most of the time of the war. He says that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</span>
now there is no real revulsion of feeling against the men
who have caused Germany’s name to be a stench in the nostrils
of the world. The soldiers returning from the front
are cheered as heroes, though their hands are caked with
the blood of innocent women and children. Not one of the
groups scheming for advantage at Berlin has expressly
repudiated the war. Not one has expressed horror at the
violation of treaties.</p>

<p>Are these pages indeed bitter? They cannot be made bitter
enough! We cannot sufficiently amplify and intensify
the innate American horror at the revealed duplicity of this
nation which we have fought and helped to beat. We find
their spirit to have been one of fiendish ingenuity, their
intellect of that curiously perverted quality to which attention
has been called. Germany never has exulted more in
the success of her armies in open warfare than in her success
at stealth and treachery. Are these the men we wish
to see marking our coming census maps?</p>

<p>We have nothing to fear from Germany. We have beaten
the Germans at every game they have produced, and we can
continue to do so. We are the victors and they are the
vanquished. They made the vast mistake of being beaten
in this war. There is no reason why we should fear them
in the future, on either side of the Atlantic. Major H. C.
Emory, a former professor at Yale, in a late address, rather
colloquially voiced something of this feeling of confidence
in his own country:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Let us get sane! Get over this German bug of thinking
that somehow or other the Germans are superior. Morally
they are greatly inferior, but people have thought that somehow,
intellectually or in organization, they are better than
the rest of the world. We have shown them that we can
smash the German military organization, which we have
smashed. There is an idea that the Germans can do us in
business; that somehow this is a race that we cannot compete
with on normally fair terms. Put that out of your head!
They are a patient, hard-working race; they will work fourteen
hours a day where a Russian won’t work four. They
will plod faithfully. But, gentlemen, they are dumb; they are
stupid. They do not understand things. They do not get
the psychology of anybody else; and a large part of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</span>
science and their supposed superior way of doing things is
bluff and fake. They have done some good work, but no
better work, and they are not doing better work, in the field
of economics than the English, the French, and the Americans.
In the field of business they have nothing on you. For the
love of Mike, don’t be afraid of them! You can put it over
them every time.</p>
</div>

<p>We need not fear either the arms, the arts or the artifices
of Germany. What we need to fear, really, is our easy-going,
unsuspicious American character, our tendency to
forget everything else in the great game of affairs. It is
time now that from the great mass of the American people
there shall appear silently, standing shoulder to shoulder
and side to side as they have in their old organization, a
new American Protective League. Our old League determined
that our homes and our property should be saved.
Let the new League determine that our country and our
principles shall be saved. All the eyes of the world turn
to America to-day. The remainder of the world is distracted.
In Berlin, radicals coming up from the dregs are
doing their best to get control of a ruined country. “Bismarck’s
structure was wonderful while it lasted,” says an
editorial in an able American paper, “but it was a nation
without a soul. It was made of blood and iron, and it
could not live because the spirit was left out.” Neither can
our civilization or our citizenship live if they are made of
silver and gold, and if the spirit be left out.</p>

<p>It is time to look at the census map of America. We must
revise those colors in the next ten years, or we have lost the
war. This distrust of Germany in America, in South America
and in Europe, is something which should excite no
sympathy and no pity whatever. Wars are not cleared up,
for example, on any basis of sympathy. There is no use
figuring what we can do to show Germany how sorry we
are. The thing to do is to leave Germany sorry. She has
coal, iron, timber, copper, potash, phosphate, abundant other
natural resources. If she cannot handle them, others can
handle them for her. Marshal Foch has threatened repeatedly
that if Germany continues cynically to disregard
the terms of the armistice, he will march again on Germany.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</span>
That is hard doctrine? Yes. But it was Germany
that lost the war.</p>

<p>It is altogether likely that not the best writing in the
world, not the most partisan history in the world, will ever
be able to give a clean bill of health to America’s conduct
of this war, or to restore the old American confidence that
we were the one great people of the world. The scales have
fallen from the eyes at least of our soldiers. They know,
and presently all the world will know, our shortcomings.
Three million men will have something to say about the
politics of this country. Perhaps they will say that our
next war shall not find us so unprepared. Perhaps they
will say that our next war shall not find us with an army
of 2,000,000 spies, propagandists and pro-enemies who claim
American citizenship. The Army man is the worst foe of
the censorship which has held back the truth from America
for so long. Perhaps the Army man will be able to settle
accounts with that politician whose stock in trade is the
holding back from the American people of the knowledge of
themselves. It is time to raise the real banner of America.
It will take courage to march under those colors. But if
we cannot march side by side and shoulder to shoulder, then
we have lost this war, we have lost the Monroe Doctrine, we
have lost the League of Nations.</p>

<p>Why should we try to avoid the truth? Nothing is gained
by that. The truth is that the reckoning of this war is not
yet paid. Eventually it must be paid through the resolution
and individual courage of those citizens who are not
ashamed to be called American. Ostracism of the hyphen,
where it is known still to exist; fearlessness in the boycott
of blood-soaked German goods; rejection of the blood-soaked
German hand; the wiping out of the foreign languages in
the pulpit and press of America; the revocation of citizenship
based on a lie; the deportation of known traitors—those
are some of the things which must go into the oath of
the next A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. Until we can swear that oath and maintain
it, we have lost the war.</p>

<p>It is a far cry enough. We have not shot one German
spy out of those thousands whom we have found working
here in America. We have not deported one man. We have
revoked the citizenship of only two men—the above mentioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</span>
Fred Würsterbarth, who had been a citizen of America
for thirty years, and Carl August Darmer, of Tacoma,
Washington, who had been a citizen in America for thirty-six
years. Do you think these two men were any worse
than a one hundred thousand others who worked as spies of
Germany? Hardly. The war remains still to be fought
against these men who still are under arms. Apply this
test to your friends and associates—to your lawyer, your
doctor, to your grocer, above all, to your alderman, your
councilman, your mayor and your representatives in Congress.
Why not? It is only the same test which the United
States District Court in New Jersey applied to Würsterbarth.</p>

<p>Eight years ago an American minister of the gospel who
had lived much abroad, especially in Germany, came back
to this country and wrote a book which perhaps never was
very popular. He held up the mirror of America to herself.
His views to-day would not be so much that of one
crying in the wilderness. Let us follow along, in a running
synopsis of the pages of his book, a hint now and then from
page to page, and see what one man thought in that long
ago before war was dreamed of; before the German army
of spies, military and industrial, had been unearthed; before
the plans of Germany for world conquest had been divulged.
That writer says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In fifty years New York will be what the Italians make it....
In New York there is only one native American to
twenty foreigners. Waterbury, Connecticut, has a population
of 30,000, 20,000 being aliens.... New Haven and Hartford,
cities of long-established colleges, have an un-American
population which in ten years will outnumber the natives....
Parts of New Jersey are more hopelessly de-Americanized
than New England. Perth Amboy has at least three
to one non-Americans. Cincinnati and Milwaukee have been
German cities for a quarter of a century; Chicago hardly less
so.... Wherever I take a meal I am served solely by
foreigners.... It seems odd that I should seldom ever
see or meet Americans except in a social or professional way,
and the professions are being rapidly filled by men of foreign
names.... The Yankee no longer counts in the industrial
and commercial life of New England. In his place is to be
found the Italians, Hungarians. French, Polocks, Scandinavians
and Jews.... Thoroughness, therefore, must now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</span>
be the watchword of the native American if he hopes to survive
in the terrific commercial battle now waging all over
the world.... This sort of thing must be stopped at
once or we are lost.... Take the half-past-seven Sunday
morning train from the New York Grand Central station, and
you will see at every way-station a swarm of dark, sturdy
foreigners entering or quitting the train at the little towns
along the way—for this is a local train and makes all the
stops—and these people are thus enabled to visit their friends
and acquaintances. And there appears to be no town, however
small, where these foreigners have not gained some footing as
laborers, farmers and small tradesmen. I should say that more
than half of the Sunday railroad traffic in New York, New
Jersey and New England is foreign. I took a train from
New York some thirty miles into New Jersey one Sunday
morning in October and the conductor told me that he did
not think the native Americans constituted ten per cent of
his passengers. I asked him whether that was the usual thing
on Sundays, and he said, “No, not quite so bad as to-day,
but we always have more foreigners than natives on
Sunday.”&nbsp;...</p>

<p>Six millions of aliens are necessary, we are told, to the
development of the resources of our country. Now, it is perfectly
plain that these foreign hordes are necessary to the
development of the multi-millionaires, the trusts and the
monopolies; but it is not so plain that they are necessary to
the peace, happiness and prosperity of this country....
The normal increase of the native American population in
the last forty years would have been amply sufficient for the
proper and healthy development of this country. Had not the
foreigner been called in in such hordes, we should have been
forced to do our own work ourselves and would have been all
the happier and richer for it.... There must be a check
put upon immigration. Self-preservation is the first law of
nature, and the time has come when we must resort to it....
We need time to train our children to compete with
these people and during that time the foreigner must be held
at bay. Immigration must be checked. The resources of this
land are being too rapidly developed by means of these
aliens.... Some radical change for the worse has taken
place in the last quarter of a century in the fibre of our life,
our manhood and our national character.... Indiscriminate
and immoderate immigration is, I believe, the main cause
of this deterioration. We have ceased long since to assimilate
the vast hordes of heterogeneous peoples who have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</span>
dumped down upon our shores and who swarm all over this
land in the eager pursuit of the mere physical necessities of
life. This is the object, the sole ambition of nine hundred
and ninety-nine out of every thousand. Such an invasion is
actually as disastrous to a country as the invasion of Germany
by the Huns who were impelled solely by hunger (the very
same motive that brings the vast majority of immigrants to
this country) and whose ravages devastated the whole of
Germany and scattered its inhabitants beyond the Alps to
the Rhine and to the borders of the Mediterranean....
Such masses of crude humanity as pour in upon us cannot
possibly be taken up into healthy circulation, but must lie
undigested in the stomach of the nation, seriously affecting its
health and happiness.... The curse these immigrants
bring upon themselves is plainly to be seen, for it is immediate.
They form a body incompatible with the healthy growth of
this country. The greater curse of this country is that they
do the work that should not be done by them at all, the work
that should be done by natives. They take the work and the
bread out of the hands and mouths of native Americans, and
the question of their means of living must soon become one
of the most pressing economic and social problems of the day.</p>
</div>

<p>Such extended quotations are made from one writer (Mr.
Monroe Royce; “The Passing of the American”) only because
these truths of ten years ago are equally true to-day
and more true. In the past ten years our census map has
changed yet more. And now into this crude population of
ours we have inducted all the seeds of discord of this war.
We have learned a sudden distrust of a large number of
our citizenry. Our returning soldiers will bring us yet more
problems. The spirit of unrest in this hour of anarchy will
add to all these problems.</p>

<p>It is time for another oath, sworn indeed for the protection
of America.</p>

THE PEACE TABLE</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The Price of Peace—The First Days After the Armistice—Ferocious
Treachery of Germany in this Country—The
Test of the Citizen—The New America.</p>
</div>

<p>To the merely morbid mind, the white faces of the starved,
the moans of the maimed, the black habiliments of those
who mourn, may be thought parts of a drama whose terrible
appeal has found no counterpart in the human emotions.
For the average man, soon to settle back to the grim struggle
of making his living, perhaps even these scenes will fade, the
world turning from them because the world can endure no
more. But someone must make the peace, must bind up the
wounds. Someone must point out the future to the staggering
peoples, dizzy from their hurts. And it is not alone
Europe which has a future to outline. Our own history is
not yet written; our own problems lie before us still.</p>

<p>What shall a just peace be? If it must be tempered with
mercy, to whom shall we show mercy—to the foe whom we
have beaten, or the coming generation of Americans whom
that foe has done all he could to betray and ruin? Shall
we fight this war through now until it actually is done; or
shall we face an indeterminate future, with possible further
yet bloodier and more appalling wars?</p>

<p>Now the dead arise and demand their justice. The world
leans over the rail of the arena, cold-faced, thumbs down,
pitiless of the armed bully who lies vanquished and whimpering.
A race which would fight as Germany has fought, and
for such reasons, will fight again when possible. Such a race
understands nothing but force. Mercy is mistaken with a
people which knows not the meaning of mercy. Britain has
a huge war bill against Germany; that of France is larger
still. What of our own bill? And what of the total of all
these sums, added to that which the war has cost Germany<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</span>
herself? If the Germans should be serfs for centuries, they
could not pay the reckoning in silver and gold alone. But
that is not the great question. What of the silent dead,
demanding also their due before Almighty God?</p>

<p>Germany never can pay her bill. So long as her language
is spoken, it will be the tongue of a debtor race whose account
never will be paid and never can be. And why should
the world forgive that debt or that debtor, even should it
find it impossible to collect the debt. What outlaws such a
debt in the just belief of the world? Shall continued arrogance
and treachery serve to outlaw that unpaid debt?
Shall a continuance in America of the old German ways in
America serve to outlaw her awful and eternally unpaid
debt?</p>

<p>Why does such feeling as this exist in the minds of the
most chivalrous of foes against whom Germany ever fought?
Why should America and France and Britain feel an implacable
hatred against a helpless enemy? In other wars
the sign of submission has arrested the wrath of warriors.
But not in this war. The world looks on beaten Germany
to-day with cold scorn and with no feeling of relenting. It
is the way that she fought—it is the spying that she did,
the brutality that she showed, which has awakened the ice-cold
wrath of the world to-day. That wrath means to exact
its pound of flesh from the heart of Germany itself. What
of the dead who died unfairly? What of the innocent and
the unarmed dead? Only in her own tears of blood could
Germany learn the humble and the contrite heart. She has
not yet learned her lesson. It must be taught her for a
century yet and more.</p>

<p>More and more as the facts shall come from Europe, uncovering
the real Germany, showing her ferocious treachery
all over the world, her utter insensibility to any feeling of
responsibility, her abysmal ignorance of such a term as
honor, shall we be ready to make fair conclusions; for these
must be our only premises.</p>

<p>It is only those who really know Germany’s methods in
America—those who know her treachery, her duplicity, her
efforts to undermine our country—who can make up a fair
judgment as to how Germany should be treated in the
future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</span></p>

<p>The members of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. have drawn aside the masks
and found hundreds of thousands of two-faced “citizens”
amenable to no sense of honor and fair play, hating the flag
they have sworn to honor. America does not need those
people. America needs only the facts about them. The
judgment thereon will be written in the next two generations
of American history.</p>

<p>The plea of Germany for food after the Armistice was
only part of her old propaganda. Her attempts to split
this country away from the Allies is now carried on only
as a part of her old systematic propaganda. It behooves
us to be well aware of such methods, since we once have
known them. Germany will not be allowed at the peace
table. She will not be allowed in the League of Nations.
Why? Because she has lost the right to shake the hand of
honorable soldiers. How about honorable citizens?</p>

<p>There is not so much bitterness as cold and relentless
reason in all such statements. But you may get a trace of
bitterness from the press of Europe, suffering as Europe
has all these years under the ruthlessness of German war.
There is indeed “every reason for belief that other pledges
would be as treacherously shattered did not the victors control
the only agency which Germany understands—sheer
material force. There can be no compassion based on any
code of sound morality for people so despicable as to snivel
for help in the midst of an orgy of cowardly iniquity. Germany
in this last and most loathsome of her ugly roles should
excite about as much legitimate sympathy as a hungry
snake.”</p>

<p>The murders of Liebknecht and of Rosa Luxemburg have
excited certain strange comment in the German press.
“What will the world think of us?” asks the German
paper <i>Vorwaerts</i>, “if we commit murders such as this?”</p>

<p>That certainly is a purely German question! It is a trifle
academic. What in Germany is the murder of one woman
or one man? The seventh of May, 1915, was proclaimed a
national holiday in Germany. On the seventh of May in
1916, 1917, 1918, the German people closed their shops and
their factories, and in holiday attire paraded the streets to
celebrate that glorious German victory when a submarine
sank an unarmed vessel and murdered more than a thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</span>
persons, many of them women and children. And now Germany
asks what the world will think of her for killing one
or two of her own people!</p>

<p>The whole truth will never be known, but more than
100,000 citizens of Belgium and France were put to death
on various pretexts; thousands of women made the sport of
violent beasts who wore the Kaiser’s uniform; thousands of
little children maimed and tortured and every conceivable
barbarity and infamy committed upon them. And yet Germany
apologizes for killing two more persons! And Dr.
Dernburg counts upon the future friendship of America!</p>

<p>It must be the just men and brave men of America who
shall constitute the court to determine the treatment of the
foreign element in America. All of those men within our
gates who retain their sympathy for Germany are enemies
of this country after the war as much as they were during
the war. They must share then in the defeat of Germany
and must pay the losses of the loser. The victor decides.
“We are the victors. Let the foreign element reflect on that—we
are the victors, not they, in this fight which they
elected. It is only the man who makes the dollar his Ten
Commandments who will feel toward Germany in America
after the war as he did before.”</p>

<p>What we Americans need is not so much a League of
Nations as a League of Americans. The soul of the American
Protective League—renamed, rechristened and reconsecrated—must
go marching on even though the League
be disbanded, its unseen banner floating no more over a
definite organization. As citizens we must unite in a common
purpose, or the war will have been lost for us no matter
what shall be the treaty at Versailles. If we open our hearts
and homes again to the former traitors at our own table,
then we have lost this war. It is of little consequence what
is done with the Kaiser—he is too pitiable a figure to be
able to pay much, even with his life. But Kaiserism in
America, still growing, still reaching out in the old ways—that
is a different thing. We were leagued against that
once, and must be leagued against it forever.</p>

<p>It is accurate enough to say that this war was no lofty
thing in any phase. It was much like any other war, based
on the biological impulse of nations to go to war almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</span>
rhythmically, almost periodically. Commercial jealousy
brought out the war, and that it was “forced on” Germany
was never anything but a pitiable lie. Germany
wanted to control the Suez Canal, to enlarge her possessions
in East Africa, to obtain the rich Indian possessions of
Great Britain. All this was to follow her defeat of England
and France, her absorption of Belgium, Denmark and
Holland, her consolidation of Middle Europe, her subjection
of the mujik population of Russia, already suborned and
bought and beaten by German propaganda. It was indeed
a grandiose scheme of world conquest. Nothing that Alexander
planned could have paralleled it. But it failed!</p>

<p>In our own country, we of the A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;L. have seen treason
weighed and bought like soap or sugar, and the price was
ready in German gold, no matter how high. Our morale was
continuously assailed. Through our colleges, our schools,
our churches, Germany always intended to undermine America
and to break down her patriotism. On the list of men
of intellect whom Germany had bought, there are, besides
a long list of college professors, fifty other names, including
judges, editors, priests, men of large affairs. The German
satyrs of diplomacy juggled huge figures carelessly in a
cold-blooded commerce which dwelt in hearts and souls and
honor. That was done merely in the hope to divide and
conquer the United States, all in good time. German-American
citizens? Why, no. Why use even that hyphen? If
they were not Americans during the war, they are not
Americans now. They are no more demobilized than Germany’s
army is demobilized. Their hearts are no more
changed than the heart of Germany has changed. If they
were not at one time above prostituting the most sacred
offices in the world, they are not above that now.</p>

<p>Let the dead speak at the peace table! Let them tell of
the simplicity and worthiness of the German character, the
German “love of liberty.” We are often told about Germany’s
part in our Civil War. We are not fighting that
war now—we are fighting this war. We are asked to distinguish
between the German rulers and the German people;
but the obvious truth was that Germany was more united
for this war than we were united for it, more than Great
Britain or France was united for it. She planned it as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</span>
exact working out of a business system—she made it her
industry, her ambition, her business enterprise for this generation.
Is such an ambition as this stifled forever in her
soul, on either side the Atlantic? Let us not be too easy
and too foolish. We are just beginning to learn about our
own citizenship. If Germany struck medals to commemorate
its gallant dead, each dead man of ours at the peace table
ought to bear that medal in his hand which would serve as
proof of Germany’s oneness with her Kaiser in this war!</p>

<p>In these merciful and liberty-loving terms a German
apostle of “kultur” writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Let us bravely organize great forced migrations of the
inferior peoples. Let them be driven into “reserves,” where
they have no room to grow ... and where, discouraged
and rendered indifferent to the future by the spectacle of the
superior energy of their conquerors, they may crawl slowly
toward the peaceful death of weary and hopeless senility.</p>
</div>

<p>Superior energy! Thrift! Efficiency! Let dead lips at
the peace table spell out those words. We remember the
<i>Alamo</i>. We remember the <i>Maine</i>. Shall we forget the
<i>Lusitania</i>?</p>

<p>That statesmanship is not acceptable American statesmanship
which plans mercy for such a people, or which
tolerates the thought of unsafely letting in more of that
breed within our country’s gates. It is a false and weak
statesmanship to mince matters in days like these. Had
Germany’s war been fought out honestly by soldiers in
uniform only, against soldiers in uniform, in accordance
with the customs among warriors, then that war might one
day be forgotten. But Belgium and France, plus von Bernstorff
and von Papen and Scheele—No, no, and again, No!
We Americans can not forget.</p>

<p>The propaganda campaign is beginning again here, now,
in America, even in the existing confusion of our industries,
in the hurrying of our own plans for demobilization. We
shall soon hear stories intended to make us believe that
France robbed us commercially, that Britain does not love
us and only used us. Can you not hear now the German
song: “The war is over now. We are at peace. Let us
forget. Kamerad!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</span></p>

<p>But we are not at peace. Our dead stand at the table
with all those other gallant dead, to demand their hearing
through all time. We must be done with foresworn citizenship
in America. We could forgive a soldier; but we cannot
forgive a naturalized German who foreswore himself
when he took the oath of allegiance to our country. That
treachery is one thing which must go—that is one thing
which shall never be forgotten or forgiven in America.
Such men as these lost their war. There is no injustice, no
unfairness in any of these words, which sound so harsh.
They set lightly on the innocent, heavily on those who have
guilt in their hearts.</p>

<p>It is for every man of foreign blood to know his own
heart—we cannot know his heart for him. He alone knows
whether he is German or American. He knows which he
wants to be. We know that he cannot be both. That is the
one test—the impossibility of a man being both a good
German and a good American. Let him choose. Let him
read his own heart. And let him remember that he is not
the victor but the vanquished in this war.</p>

<p>One great American—I fancy even his enemies will
allow him that title now—wrote as his final message to
America the real answer to this war as it applies to us in
America. Colonel Roosevelt’s last plea was for Americanism.
It was read at an All-American Benefit Concert by a
trustee of the society, because of the Colonel’s indisposition:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I cannot be with you, and so all I can do is wish you
Godspeed. There must be no sagging back in the fight for
Americanism merely because the war is over. There are
plenty of persons who have already made the assertion that
they believe the American people have a short memory, and
that they intend to revive all the foreign associations which
most directly interfere with the complete Americanization of
our people.</p>

<p>Our principle in this matter should be absolutely simple.
In the first place, we should insist that if the immigrant, who
comes here in good faith, becomes an American and assimilates
himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with
everyone else, for it is an outrage to discriminate against any
such man because of creed, or birthplace or origin.</p>

<p>But this is predicated upon the man’s becoming <i>in fact an
American and nothing but an American</i>. If he tries to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</span>
segregated with men of his own origin, and separated from
the rest of America, then he isn’t doing his part as an
American.</p>

<p>There can be no divided allegiance here. Any man who
says he is an American, but something else also, isn’t an
American at all. We have room for but one flag, the American
flag, and this excludes the red flag, which symbolizes all
wars against liberty and civilization, just as much as it excludes
any flag of a nation to which we are hostile.</p>
</div>

<p>To that doctrine, and to that alone, can the dead at the
peace table nod their voiceless assent. By that doctrine
only, continually kept alive, continually enforced, can their
deaths ever be justified and made glorious indeed. Under
that doctrine and for that purpose, we, who have our war
to fight out here in America for a generation and more, can
continue the battle, knowing that it is for a good cause, and
knowing that we shall win.</p>

<p>The old oath of the American Protective League exists no
more. The silent army has disbanded. But now it remains
the privilege of each of those men, and their sons and brothers,
to enlist again in a yet greater army, and to swear a
yet greater oath, each for himself, at his own bedside,
gravely and solemnly:</p>

<p><i>THIS is my country. I have no other country. I swear
to be loyal to her always, to protect her and to defend her
always, and in all ways. In my heart this is the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth. So help me God!</i></p>

HISTORICAL STATEMENT OF HINTON G. CLABAUGH,<br>
DIVISION SUPERINTENDENT, <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> BUREAU<br>
OF INVESTIGATION
</h3>

<p>Shortly after the severance of diplomatic relations between the
United States and Germany on February 1, 1917, Mr. A. M. Briggs,
then vice-president of a poster advertising company of New York,
Chicago and elsewhere, whom I had met in connection with several
official investigations, called at the office of the Bureau of
Investigation, and made substantially the following statement:
“Diplomatic relations have been severed and in all probability
this country will be drawn into the European war. I am physically
unable to join the active fighting forces, but I would like to help
in some way, and it has occurred to me that a volunteer organization
might be of great assistance to an investigating bureau such
as the one with which you are connected. I hereby pledge all
my time and all my resources. I am not a man of much wealth,
but the Government is welcome to every dollar I possess, as well
as my time, and I earnestly hope that if you can think of any way
in which I can be of assistance to this Bureau you will command
me.”</p>

<p>In the meantime I had a conference with the late Herman F.
Schuettler, then General Superintendent of Police of Chicago, and
attended a meeting of prominent citizens of this community in
the Federal Building.</p>

<p>Subsequently, or a few days after the first conversation, I told
Mr. Briggs I had been thinking about his idea and believed that
an organization of volunteers would be of very great help to the
Department, and as a first step in connection with such organization
we could use some automobiles, which would enable the agents
to cover several times as much territory, to say nothing of the
time thus saved, but that there was no appropriation from which
the Government could pay for the upkeep of such cars. I also
explained to him the substance of some telegrams which I had
exchanged on the subject with Mr. A. Bruce Bielaski, Chief of the
Bureau of Investigation at Washington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Briggs on February 26th tendered the Chicago office three
good cars, and offered to furnish a car, or cars, for the New York
and Washington offices, as per my telegram to the Chief of the
Bureau, dated February 27, 1917.</p>

<p>On February 27, 1917, I wrote the following letter to Mr. Bielaski,
Chief of the Bureau:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This letter will introduce to you Mr. A. M. Briggs, concerning
whom I have already telegraphed and written you. Please be
sure to have Mr. Briggs meet Mr. Wrisley Brown, Mr. Horn and
Mr. Pike; and I should also like to have him meet Mr. Suter if
he is in.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Mr. Wrisley Brown referred to was Special Assistant to
the Attorney General, and is now Major Wrisley Brown of the
Military Intelligence Division. Mr. Raymond Horn, Mr. A. H.
Pike and Mr. John Gardner were assistants to the Chief of the
Bureau. Mr. Suter was Private Secretary to the Attorney General.</p>

<p>On February 28, Mr. Bielaski sent me the following telegram:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“Department Justice, Washington.<br>
<br>
“Hinton G. Clabaugh,<br>
Bureau of Investigation, Chicago.
</p>

<p>“Wire immediately whether acceptance offer automobiles would
be used as advertisement in any way. Believe Congress opposed
any advertisement feature. Bielaski.”</p>
</div>

<p>On February 28, 1917, I wired Mr. Bielaski as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“A. B. Bielaski,<br>
Department Justice, Washington.
</p>

<p>“Telegram received. Offer of four automobiles for Chicago, four
for New York, three for Washington, referred to in telegram, not
intended in any way as advertisement. In fact, specifically stated
to contrary. Clabaugh.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Briggs also tendered a gift of fifty to seventy-five automobiles,
to be divided up among the various offices of the Bureau, in
the principal cities, where they could be used to best advantage,
without any cost to the Government whatsoever, as per my letter
to the Chief of the Bureau of February 27, 1917.</p>

<p>On March 14, 1917, I sent a personal letter to Mr. Bielaski,
Chief of the Bureau, enclosing a letter addressed to me by Mr.
Briggs under date of March 14, a copy of which I have and which
is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“Hinton G. Clabaugh,<br>
Bureau of Investigation, Chicago.<br>
<br>
“My dear Mr. Clabaugh:
</p>

<p>“Believing that the Department of Justice is at this time in need<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</span>
of possible assistance in their work and that a volunteer organization,
properly built and controlled, could render valuable and
efficient service, I beg to submit the following for your consideration:</p>

<p>Its Purpose: A volunteer organization to aid the Bureau of
Investigation of the Department of Justice.</p>

<p>The Object: To work with and under the direction of the Chief
of the Bureau of Investigation, of the Department of Justice, or
such attorney, or persons as he may direct, rendering such service
as may be required from time to time.</p>

<p>Membership: This organization is to be composed of citizens
of good moral character who shall volunteer their services and
who are acceptable to your Department.</p>

<p>Construction: It is proposed that national headquarters be
established either in Washington, or perhaps Chicago, because of
its geographical location, and that branch organizations be established
in such cities as your Department may direct.</p>

<p>Finances: It is proposed that headquarters organization and
branch organizations shall finance themselves either by outside
subscriptions or by its members.</p>

<p>Control: It is proposed that each unit of this organization shall
be under the control of the Government but will report to and be
under the direction of the nearest Department of Justice headquarters.</p>

<p>Trusting you will give the foregoing your consideration,</p>

<p class="right">
(Signed) A. M. Briggs.”
</p>
</div>

<p>On March 19, 1917, Mr. Bielaski telegraphed me as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“Hinton G. Clabaugh,<br>
Bureau of Investigation, Chicago.
</p>

<p>“Replying your letter fourteenth Briggs should be encouraged in
organization volunteer association. Be glad talk with him about
matter. Letter follows. Bielaski.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Bielaski confirmed his telegram by letter under date of
March 20th, which reads in part as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“Hinton G. Clabaugh, Chicago.
</p>

<p>“In reply to your letter of the 14th, with respect to letter addressed
to you by Mr. A. M. Briggs of Chicago under date of 14th,
I beg to advise you that this Department is encouraging the
organization of volunteer associations to aid the Government in
securing information as to the activities of foreign Governments
or unfriendly aliens.</p>

<p>“In the pressure of business your desire for an immediate answer
was overlooked, but I have just telegraphed you the gist of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</span>
letter. This organization should be handled as confidentially as
practicable, and care taken that nothing is done by it to unnecessarily
alarm aliens in this country or cause them any apprehension
as to the fair manner in which they will be treated, and no
arrests should be caused, except after consultation with the federal
authorities, in order that there may be no confusion.</p>

<p>“I will take no further action in this matter until I hear from
Mr. Briggs or yourself.”</p>
</div>

<p>On March 20, I telegraphed Mr. Briggs as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“A. M. Briggs,<br>
Hotel Claridge, New York City.
</p>

<p>“Just received following telegram from Chief Bielaski: ‘Replying
your letter 14th, Briggs should be encouraged in organization
volunteer association. Be glad talk with him about matter. Letter
follows.’ Personally, foregoing makes me very happy, as it does you,
I am sure. Please wire what day you will confer with Chief.
Clabaugh.”</p>
</div>

<p>On March 20, I received the following telegram, dated New
York, from Mr. Briggs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“Hinton G. Clabaugh,<br>
Bureau of Investigation, Chicago.
</p>

<p>“Great news. Will see Chief Washington Thursday morning
nine thirty. Please arrange appointment. Briggs.”</p>
</div>

<p>I then wired the Chief of the Bureau, and on March 22, Mr.
Briggs wired me from Washington as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“Hinton G. Clabaugh,<br>
Bureau of Investigation, Chicago.
</p>

<p>“Very satisfactory interview. Chief has approved. Organization,
our original plan, to be formed immediately. See you Saturday.
Briggs.”</p>
</div>

<p>Thus it was that Chicago was the first city in the United States
to have such an organization. It was the idea of Mr. A. M.
Briggs, and of no one else. Although in public speeches, letters
and upon other occasions he has been generous enough to credit
the idea to me, I want it positively understood that the whole
scheme was his thought, and it is due to his untiring energy and
sacrifice that the organization was started and put on its feet
during the early period of its history, when many people were
inclined to look upon it and ridicule it as “a bunch of volunteer
detectives, etc.” Mr. Briggs personally defrayed all expenses in
the early history of the organization. National headquarters were
here in the Peoples Gas Building and the Chicago Division was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</span>
formed as well. Thomas B. Crockett was Assistant Chief of the
national organization prior to the time, or until the time, he was
made a Major in the Army, and assigned to the Intelligence
Branch, Central Department.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the war, the Bureau of Investigation handled
all complaints of violations of so-called federal war laws, the
enforcement of which were not specifically charged to other departments
or bureaus by statute. In time, however, the military authorities
established a bureau of Military Intelligence, and the Navy
established in Chicago the Aid for Information and Naval Intelligence
Bureau.</p>

<p>Under the direction of the Bureau of Investigation, a War
Board was formed, consisting of representatives of the following
Investigating Bureaus:</p>

<p>Chairman: Hinton G. Clabaugh, Division Superintendent, Bureau
of Investigation, Department of Justice.</p>

<p>Colonel Carl Reichmann, former Military Intelligence Officer,
Central Department, War Department.</p>

<p>Major T. B. Crockett, Military Intelligence Officer.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Edwin L. Reed, Aide for Information, 9th, 10th and
11th Naval Districts.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Commander Clive Runnells, Naval Intelligence
Officer.</p>

<p>General James E. Stuart, Post Office Inspector in Charge.</p>

<p>Colonel L. G. Nutt, Supervising Agent, Internal Revenue.</p>

<p>H. R. Landis, Inspector in Charge Immigration Service.</p>

<p>John J. Bradley, <span class="nowrap">U. S.</span> Marshal.</p>

<p>Charles Howe Bradley, Special Agent in Charge, Treasury
Department.</p>

<p>Davis S. Groh, Special Agent in Charge, Plant Protection Division,
War Department.</p>

<p>John H. Winterbotham, Chairman, Chicago Division, American
Protective League.</p>

<p>Robert A. Gunn, Chief, Chicago Division, American Protective
League.</p>

<p>John H. Alcock, former Acting General Superintendent of Police.</p>

<p>John J. Garrity, General Superintendent of Police.</p>

<p>Morgan Collins, former First Deputy, Superintendent of Police.</p>

<p>By degrees the League, through the Bureau, tendered its services
to these several branches.</p>

<p>In this necessarily brief and naked sketch of the early days of
the American Protective League, I ought to add just a word or so
regarding the composition and the purposes of this War Board.
I called a meeting of the heads of the various federal investigation
bureaus of the several departments of the Government, having to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</span>
do with investigation involving the detection and prosecution of
crime under Federal laws, and the general superintendent of
police, who represents the local authorities. The purpose of this
meeting of the committee was to discuss various matters relating
to individual bureaus, with the idea of coördinating the work
and to have maximum efficiency with minimum confusion and
expense, and thus to avoid unnecessary duplication of work. A
committee representing two or three departments was appointed,
which met almost daily for many months. This committee was of
invaluable assistance. It kept the various heads of bureaus working
together in harmonious coöperation, and many constructive
ideas were put into effect.</p>

<p>Chief Thomas I. Porter, Operator in charge of the Secret Service
Division, Treasury Department, nominated me for Chairman. The
nomination was seconded by Colonel Carl Reichmann, Military
Intelligence Officer, and unanimously approved, although I favored
the selection of one of the older men. Captain Charles Daniel
Frey, later of the Military Intelligence Division at Washington,
and one of the National Directors, attended the first meeting, and
was selected secretary of the committee.</p>

<p><i>The Chicago Bureau, assisted by the American Protective League,
has conducted some of the most important investigations in the
country. It is my judgment that the convictions under war laws
in the Chicago district will equal that of any three cities in the
country. While comparisons are odious, I am referring to the
record as a matter of pride rather than egotism.</i></p>

<p>Topping the list with the famous I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. trial, as late as
May, 1917, it was believed that the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. situation was one
which should be handled by the state authorities, but their activities
and the history of the organization were such that the Government
undertook to follow it up officially shortly after that time.</p>

<p>I was placed in charge of the investigation at Chicago. A branch
bureau was established in the McCormick Building, and assisted
by a number of Special Agents, we worked there continuously,
not coming near the Federal Building for eight or ten weeks, until
on September 5, 1917, the Government, through search warrant
process under the Espionage Act, raided I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. headquarters
in approximately one hundred different places throughout the
country simultaneously. The prosecution was in charge of Special
Assistants to the Attorney General, Frank K. Nebeker, Frank C.
Dailey and Claude R. Porter, as well as Oliver E. Pagan, Indictment
Expert and Special Assistant to the Attorney General, and
U. S. District Attorney Charles F. Clyne.</p>

<p>Indictments were subsequently returned. A trial, lasting a
number of months, was had, which resulted in convicting about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</span>
one hundred, or practically all of the active leaders of the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W.
movement, ninety-seven of whom were sentenced by Federal Judge
Landis and are now serving sentences in Leavenworth Federal
Penitentiary. Cases are pending, as this is being written, against
other leaders of the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. in Sacramento, Kansas City, Omaha
and elsewhere.</p>

<p>In connection with the preparation of the evidence at Chicago,
I take this occasion to commend most highly the efficient, untiring
assistance of Special Agent George N. Murdock, of the Indianapolis
office, who was assigned to Chicago and relieved me of the investigating
detail work in December, 1917, and he continued to assist
those in charge of the case throughout the trial. Mr. Murdock is
still Special Agent of the Department of Justice, in active charge
of the investigating work at Sacramento, Kansas City, Omaha and
elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Investigation and the American Protective League
are very greatly indebted to the late Herman F. Schuettler, then
General Superintendent of Police of Chicago, for his competency
and very great assistance personally, also his entire Police Department,
in helping make the American Protective League a success
in Chicago. The same is true of John H. Alcock, former Acting
General Superintendent of Police, Morgan Collins, First Deputy
Superintendent of Police, and other officials of the Police Department.</p>

<p>I shall therefore not burden this memorandum except to call
attention to the famous Rockford draft cases, which resulted in
the conviction of about one hundred persons. (Rockford is the
entry-point for Camp Grant Cantonment.)</p>

<p>After war had been declared and during the discussion in Congress
of the Draft Act, the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. members and their sympathizers
carried on an active campaign against the Act, and when
the Act was passed, simply advised their members not to register.
They were particularly active in the Chicago Division, as well
as around Rockford. To insure carrying out their plans at Rockford,
an all-day meeting and picnic was announced for June 5 at
Blackhawk Park for the purpose of keeping their members and
sympathizers together until after the close of the registration
booths in order to prevent their registration.</p>

<p>On June 6, 1917, Wait Talcott, Chief of the American Protective
League at Rockford, presented the facts to me and he was directed
to request the local authorities in Rockford to take steps to apprehend
all those who had not registered. Late in the afternoon
three were apprehended and locked up in the county jail. This
act enraged the leaders of the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. Meetings were held,
demanding the release of the persons in custody. Upon adjournment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</span>
of the meetings the members marched in a body through
the principal streets of Rockford to the jail, about a mile and a
quarter away, and a demand was made to release the prisoners.
Upon the Sheriff’s refusal to do so, the mob incited a riot, as a
result of which, arrests were made of the leaders and persons
known to be in sympathy with the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. and placed in jail.
About one hundred and thirty-five arrests were made. At the time
standing room only was available in the jail. Sheriff Guy Ginders
of Rockford arranged with the Sheriffs of Boone and Stevenson
Counties to accept some of the prisoners. With this end in view
special interurban cars were chartered. Thirty-five were taken to
Boone County, forty-five to Stevenson County, and about thirty
remained in the Rockford city jail. Before the transfers were
made all the glass in the windows of the jail was broken and most
of the plumbing wrecked. The leader, James Cully, was indicted
by the Federal Grand Jury, tried in the federal court, found guilty,
and sentenced to Leavenworth Penitentiary. A majority of the
balance were indicted by the federal grand jury for failure to
register, and about 107 were sentenced to a maximum of one year
in the Bridewell at Chicago.</p>

<p><i>This case, together with the I.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. case at Chicago, makes
a total of 212 defendants convicted in two cases—a record, I
believe, in the Federal Courts of this country. The American
Protective League aided the Department in both of these important
cases.</i></p>

<p>As I understand it, “The Web” will be a history of the League
as an organization rather than a work referring to any individuals
connected with it, but, nevertheless, I desire to say that in addition
to Mr. A. M. Briggs, both Captain Charles Daniel Frey and
Mr. Victor Elting, who later became National Directors at Washington,
but who were Chief and Assistant Chief respectively of
the Chicago Division in its early days, deserve the highest possible
praise for the work done by them and the sacrifices they
made in putting the League on its feet. Mr. Robert A. Gunn,
formerly Assistant Chief, later Chief of the Chicago Division, is
also entitled to highest possible praise for his untiring devotion
to the service. Mr. John H. Winterbotham, Chairman of the
Board of Governors at Chicago, who was one of the first members
of the League, and who aided it in its financial development
and other work, besides traveling through a number of cities in
the middle west, appointing local chiefs of the League, etc., has
done as much as any other man to perpetuate and make the
League a success. The League will never be able to repay Mr.
John F. Gilchrist, its Chief for many months during a very trying
period, for his able leadership and devotion to the work. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</span>
ever available, at all hours of the day and night, and with his
assistants is entitled to the credit for making the Chicago Division
what it is.</p>

<p><i>Without exaggeration, I think the Chicago Division of the
American Protective League did seventy-five percent of the Government
investigating work throughout the war. It seems to me
that this one sentence covers the situation.</i></p>

<p>When Captain Charles Daniel Frey was Chief of the Chicago
Division, there was never a more active, energetic worker, and
while I am not personally familiar with his work at Washington,
I feel sure it was in keeping with what I know he did at Chicago.</p>

<p>In addition to working for all Government bureaus, and helping
in thousands of investigations, the League conducted a famous so-called
“Slacker Drive” in Chicago during the period July 11 to 15,
inclusive, 1918, and apprehended, or caused to go to the local
boards to straighten out their records, 40,167 delinquents. The
total number of deserters and delinquents apprehended during
the period of the war, or taken to the local boards and inducted
into the service, or permitted to file their questionnaire, or register,
totaled approximately 67,000. Not one word of criticism was heard
of the Chicago raid. During the four days, approximately 200,000
persons between the ages of 21 and 31 were questioned. Hotels,
cafés, saloons, baseball parks, moving-picture theatres, railroad
depots, and other places where people are wont to congregate,
were visited systematically and simultaneously throughout the
district. A few who were unnecessarily detained, or believed they
should not have been detained, instead of filing a protest, congratulated
the Department and stated that their slight inconvenience
was nothing to compare with the duty they owed to the
community in aiding the authorities in apprehending those who
had not complied with the law. The press, throughout the period
of the war, aided the League and the Bureau of Investigation in
every possible way.</p>

<p>In addition to the automobile service rendered free of charge
to the Government by the American Protective League, there grew
out of this idea an organization known as the Emergency Drivers
of Chicago, composed exclusively of women who devoted their
entire time and machines, without cost to the Government, to
driving the agents around this vicinity. They maintained, from
the beginning of the war down to the present time, an office in
the Rookery Building, and furnished this Bureau with an average
of fifteen to twenty automobiles per day. Mrs. Frederick D.
Countiss, whose husband, Mr. Frederick D. Countiss, was also
active in the American Protective League work, was responsible
for this organization, and subsequently Miss Florence Spofford
was Chairman of the Chicago Division. The organization was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</span>
afterward taken over by the American Red Cross, and is now
known as the American Red Cross Automobile Drivers, although,
because of the manner in which it originated, it has always
maintained an independent branch in the Rookery Building, over
which Miss Spofford presided and which continued to furnish
assistance to this Bureau. Personally, I doubt whether there is
a single member of the American Protective League or emergency
driver who appreciates just how much this volunteer assistance
has meant to the Government during the war.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="APPENDIX_B">APPENDIX B<br>
CONFIDENTIAL CONSTITUTION OF THE AMERICAN PROTECTIVE
LEAGUE AS FIRST OUTLINED TO MEMBERS</h3>

<p>Executive control of the organization is centered in a Board
of National Directors operating from National Headquarters at
Washington, D. C., in coöperation with the Department of Justice,
and through it with other departments and agencies of the Government;
this Board being established to coördinate the activities
of the local branches throughout the country.</p>

<p>Divisional headquarters are established in the various States
to coördinate the work of local branches operating throughout
the divisional territory; to keep in touch with the work of each;
to promote their efficiency and to render them practical assistance;
and to establish and maintain ready communication with Agents
in Charge of the Bureau of Investigation of the United States
Department of Justice; and to develop methods of operation.</p>

<p>The work of the American Protective League in the field is performed
through the local branches. The Chief of the Local Branch
is appointed, and is subject to removal, by the Board of National
Directors. He is the directing head of the organization and responsible
therefor. He will appoint an Assistant Chief; and, in
his discretion, an Advisory Committee.</p>

<p>Members of the organization must be American citizens of legal
age, of good character and absolute loyalty, who undertake to
serve from patriotic motives and without compensation. The reward
of a member is the opportunity to serve the Government in
a responsible way in matters of grave importance. The selection
of members is a most important duty devolving upon the Chief,
both because the future efficiency of the Local Branch is dependent
upon its personnel, and because of the potential danger involved
in mistakes in enrollment. The interest of the Government and
the ability of the candidate to render efficient service are the first
considerations and are paramount to any considerations of business,
family or friendship.</p>

<p>Every member of the organization must subscribe and swear
to the formal oath before enrollment. This rule will be rigidly
enforced and no member will be recognized as such until this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</span>
action has been taken. The candidate will be sworn in before an
officer qualified to administer oaths.</p>

<p>Strict observance by members of the rules and regulations of
the organization is required. The Government must not be embarrassed
by unauthorized action of members in the attempted performance
of their duties. Experience has demonstrated the value
of a Trial Board consisting of disinterested and responsible members
of sound and unprejudiced judgment.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Finance procures the funds necessary for the
work of the organization from voluntary contribution of citizens,
and has charge of all expenditures. It is important that an accurate
system of requisition and voucher be installed and that all
contributions be strictly accounted for. Periodic audits should be
made at regular intervals. No volunteer member of the League
should be allowed to profit through his service.</p>

<p>Local Branches should not derive their revenue from any single
person or interest, but should secure them from various sources
so that no individual or business interest shall at any time be in
a position to dictate as to the personnel, policy or activity of the
Local Branch. Great care should be exercised that no alien enemy,
or person in sympathy with the cause of the enemy, be allowed to
contribute money and thereby discredit the organization. Experience
has shown that through appreciation of the protection afforded
the community by a competent local organization, adequate
funds may readily be secured from responsible citizens. Each
Local Branch is self-supporting, and will be requested to make
its proportionate contribution toward defraying the expenses of
the National and Divisional Headquarters. The efficient operation
of these Headquarters, and their usefulness to the Local Branches,
require adequate quarters, equipment and clerical assistance; and
involve large expense for printing and distribution of bulletins of
instruction and other literature.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Law maintains an adequate corps of competent
lawyers. It advises operatives upon all matters relating to their
work, including questions of right and authority, the competency
of evidence, etc. It assigns individual attorneys to direct particular
investigations, and gives advice as to the construction of
laws. It revises the reports of operatives, and briefs the same
for submission to the Bureau of Investigation of the Department
of Justice. In large and thickly populated communities a zone or
district system of organization has proven most effective, members
being assigned according to their residence. Under this plan the
territory is divided into inspection districts, each under the command
of an inspector. Each inspection district is in turn subdivided
into convenient territorial units, each under the direction
of a captain. Under each captain is a company consisting of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</span>
requisite number of platoons, each under the command of a lieutenant.
No platoon should exceed ten men in size. Each inspector
is definitely responsible to the Chief for the territory in
his district, and each captain is responsible to his inspector for
the territory assigned to him. Cases for investigation within a
district are assigned to the inspector for that district and by him
through a captain to the men best fitted for the work. An auxiliary
squad for emergency work may operate directly from headquarters.</p>

<p>Experience has shown that a company under a captain should
not exceed fifty men. The organization of a company is indicated
in the general chart.</p>

<p>The Investigation Bureau should establish and maintain a close
association with the Agent in Charge of the Bureau of Investigation
of the United States in order to render the greatest possible
assistance to the Department of Justice. In the larger cities and
wherever possible it is highly desirable that a Special Agent of
the Department of Justice be assigned to the Local Branch to
direct the work of investigation.</p>

<p>It is the duty of each division chief to extend the organization
throughout the city within the lines of his department in such
manner as to attain so far as practicable the following ends: (1)
the enlistment of responsible persons of sufficient number in each
bank, business house and industrial plant of importance, whose
sworn duty it will be to promptly report through the proper
channel all cases of disloyalty, industrial disturbance, or other
matter likely to injure or embarrass the Government of the United
States; and (2) the establishment of an organization, through
such means, which will at all times be ready and able to assist
the operation of the Investigation Bureau of the Local Branch and
of the Department of Justice when their investigations shall require
an entrance into and the securing of information from such
banking, business or industrial establishments.</p>

<p>In this Bureau large numbers of citizens will be enrolled, forming
<i>a WEB of communication</i> throughout the community, by means
of which quick and responsible report will be made of any and all
matters affecting the welfare of the country during the present
crisis. The duty of members to report will extend to all industrial,
social or political plans or conspiracies, and to all other
activities or utterances, designed to embarrass the Government in
the prosecution of the war.</p>

<p>In extending the organization each Division Supervisor, after
his enrollment, will prepare a comprehensive plan covering the
ground of his division. He will then proceed to enlist as Deputies
under him, a responsible man in each plant or business house
within his jurisdiction, such deputies to be executive officers of
their respective business concerns if practicable. The deputies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</span>
after enrollment will select as aids a reliable man in each department
of the business, preferably a superintendent, foreman or
other man filling a responsible position in his department. The
deputies will then confer with the aids and explain to them the
nature of the organization and the scope of their duties. The
aids will suggest to the deputies the names of several trusted
employes in each department who are American citizens of legal
age and who, on account of their long service and general character,
can be relied upon for loyal service to the country and the
employer. The men so suggested as Reporters will not be approached
in the matter by the deputies or aids. After the selection
of the aids and reporters, the deputy will report his complete
plan of organization to the Chief of the Local Branch, and upon
approval of the organization the aids and reporters will be directed
by the Chief to attend at convenient times for the purpose of being
sworn in.</p>

<p>The Real Estate Division reports all information secured by its
members, and furnishes investigators with facts connected with
the construction of buildings and occupations of and removals from
office buildings, houses and apartments.</p>

<p>The Financial Division includes banks, stock and bond houses
and safety deposit vaults, reports all information coming to its
members, and furnishes to investigators facts with regard to
foreign transactions, use of alien enemy funds and transactions
with Germans. The department will furnish valuable information
in connection with the use of safety deposit vaults by alien
enemies.</p>

<p>The Insurance Division provides useful information through
insurance inspectors of the character and use of buildings and
plants, and reports upon casualties; it also provides life insurance
data upon individuals and details of marine insurance.</p>

<p>The Professional Division includes engineers, accountants,
physicians and other professions, and in addition to reporting
information coming to the knowledge of its members, is called
upon for professional assistance and advice in connection with
work of the investigators.</p>

<p>The Hotels Division includes hotels, restaurants and theatres.
The division is organized so that responsible persons will be enlisted
in all departments of all of the hotels and restaurants.
They will be able to make prompt and reliable reports on the
doings of all transients and others connected with the hotels
and restaurants.</p>

<p>The Transportation Division covers all railroads, shipping, taxicabs
and teaming. This division will report information and
assist in investigations throughout these interests.</p>

<p>The Public Utilities Division includes all lines and methods of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</span>
communication, including telephone, telegraph, wireless, electric
light, gas, elevated and traction lines and other local transportation.</p>

<p>The General Merchandise Division includes mail order houses,
department stores, retail and wholesale houses.</p>

<p>The Division of Industries is subdivided as follows: munitions,
war equipment, metal trades, lumber trades, electrical, packing
houses, grain, foodstuffs, chemicals and paints, and miscellaneous.
The Miscellaneous Subdivision will include, under separate deputies,
automobiles, building material, cigars and tobacco, coal, contractors,
leather, motion picture producers, paper trades, photographers,
and printers and engravers.</p>

<p>Any one of these subdivisions may be of sufficient importance
in a given community to constitute a separate Division. On the
other hand, many of the above divisions when locally unimportant
may be included in “Miscellaneous.”</p>

<p>The work of each Local Branch is under the responsible direction
and control of the Local Chief. He is responsible for the
efficiency of the work. It is essential that an Assistant Chief be
appointed to counsel with the Chief and to act with authority in
his absence.</p>

<p>In cities of larger size an office in good location, convenient to
the Department of Justice, is desirable. An efficient organization
will readily command adequate financial support, and the work
will be carried on with less publicity and greater efficiency in an
independent office, suitably equipped. Adequate clerical and stenographic
help should be provided so that investigations and reports
may be promptly made.</p>

<p>In connection with the central office the services of volunteer
interpreters should be available at all times for translating papers
and interviewing witnesses.</p>

<p>Full coöperation with Government and police officials should
be promptly secured so that they may be quickly available in all
cases of emergency.</p>

<p>The work of the various Branches and Divisions should be coordinated
through the central office so that information or assistance
of any kind may be promptly secured at any time by any
member from any other department through the established
channel.</p>

<p>Each Local Branch will operate in close coöperation with and
under the general direction of the Government Agent in charge
of the nearest office of the Bureau of Investigation of the Department
of Justice, and all reports of investigations, unless otherwise
directed, will be made to him. The Local Branch will coöperate
at all times, through the Department of Justice, with other Governmental
Departments and agencies, but will undertake no work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</span>
from them by direct assignment except with the knowledge of the
Bureau of Investigation of the United States Department of Justice,
or by instruction from National Headquarters. It is the desire
of the organization to render useful service to all Departments
of the Government.</p>

<p><i>Members will always be mindful of the fact that they are acting
in the interests of the Department of Justice of the United States
and conduct themselves with dignity, tact and discretion. They
must refrain from words and conduct in any way calculated to
bring the Government or the organization into disrespect.</i></p>

<p><i>The work of the members must be carried on wholly without
publicity or personal advertisement.</i></p>

<p>Members will not discuss cases assigned to them with other
members or officers of the organization, but will make their reports
to their immediate superiors. Members will not take outside
individuals into their confidence.</p>

<p>Members must not permit the source of information of any complaint,
or the name of the complainant, to be disclosed under any
circumstances. They will state in all cases where opportunity
offers that neither the American Protective League nor the Department
of Justice will disclose directly or indirectly to any person
the name or the complainant or any person giving information
with regard to the suspect. This cannot be too strongly impressed
upon all persons with whom the organization comes in contact.</p>

<p>No member shall inform the suspect or his family of the fact of
the investigation, or interview them regarding the subject of inquiry,
without direct authority from his Captain or Chief.</p>

<p>Members will not disclose to suspects, or to persons not connected
with the organization, the names of other members or officers
of the League. It is important that the work of the League
be impersonal. The enforcement of this rule is likewise necessary
to safeguard the officers and members of the League in their work.</p>

<p>Abuse of their credentials by members by public exhibition or
otherwise will be ground for immediate discharge from membership.
The use of such credentials under an assumption of authority
for the purpose of escaping penalties for automobile speeding, or
otherwise, or to secure special privileges in theatres, street cars
and other public places is likewise ground for dismissal. No member
will be permitted by such means to embarrass the organization
in its work and in its relation with public officials.</p>

<p>Members are not privileged through membership in the organization
to carry firearms or other weapons forbidden by law. The
carrying of such weapons at any time is wholly upon the responsibility
of the individual.</p>

<p>No member will be exempt from military service under the requirements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</span>
of the Selective Service Regulations, or otherwise, by
reason of his membership in the organization.</p>

<p>Members will carefully avoid any representation, direct or indirect,
that they are Government officers; and will particularly
avoid any statement or implication that they are members of the
“Secret Service Department of the United States.” The American
Protective League is organized with the approval and is operating
under the direction of the United States Department of Justice,
Bureau of Investigation. It is not connected with the Secret
Service Division of the Treasury Department.</p>

<p>When making investigations after receipt of instructions members
of the American Protective League are authorized to state
that they are making the investigation “for the Department of
Justice.”</p>

<p>Members of the American Protective League have no general
powers of arrest. They are investigators only, and have no greater
power than private citizens in the matter of arrests. As a general
rule a citizen can make an arrest without warrant where a felony
has been committed in his presence, but there is no authority for
a citizen to make an arrest without a warrant to prevent the commission
of a misdemeanor, or for a misdemeanor committed in his
presence which does not amount to a breach of the peace. At
common law, and except where changed by statute, it is the duty
of every citizen to assist in preserving the public peace and safety.
Any citizen may arrest without a warrant one who commits a
breach of the peace in his presence, or where there is reasonable
ground for apprehension that the arrested person is about to
commit a breach of the peace. It is essential to justify such an
arrest that the offense committed shall amount to a breach of the
peace, that such offense shall have been actually committed or
attempted in the presence of the person making the arrest, and
that the arrest be made at the time when the offense was committed.
No private person has the right to make an arrest for
a misdemeanor without a warrant after the event or upon mere
information or suspicion. The term “breach of the peace” is a
generic one, and includes riots, unlawful assemblies, riotous and
wanton discharge of firearms in the public streets, affrays, assaults,
the use of profane, indecent and abusive language on the
street, and in the presence of others, and other acts destroying
public order and tranquility. The right of citizens in this regard,
however, depends somewhat upon the Statutes of the several States
and members should be advised by their Local Chiefs of their
authority in the premises. They should act only where the regular
police officers are not reasonably available and where inaction may
be productive of serious results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</span></p>

<p>Under the laws of the United States (Act of August 29, 1916;
C. 418, Sec. 3) it is lawful for any civil officer having authority
under the laws of the United States or of any State, Territory,
District, or possession of the United States to arrest offenders,
summarily to arrest a deserter from the military service of the
United States. Under the opinion of the Judge Advocate General
of the Army (C. 17327-1) a citizen acting under an order or direction
of a military officer may apprehend a deserter, but a citizen,
and this term includes a member of the American Protective
League, has no authority as such to arrest a deserter from the
army in the absence of a special request or direction of a military
officer.</p>

<p>It is seldom that the necessity for arrest arises. In such a case
the member will notify his Chief who will secure prompt action
by the proper authorities.</p>

<p>Cases will be assigned for investigation by the Chief to inspectors
and by them transmitted through the captains to the
lieutenants, who will assign them to the members best qualified
for the particular work. All reports must be submitted in writing
through the lieutenants and captains to the inspectors, and by
the inspectors to the central office. All reports of a confidential
nature should be brought to the office by the inspectors in person
or by private messenger. In the smaller cities where inspection
districts are not created, the above rules will be accordingly
modified.</p>

<p>All investigations and reports are the business of the League
and must become matters of permanent record. They may not be
suppressed or destroyed, but must be disposed of in regular course
through the established channels of the Bureau of Investigation of
the United States Department of Justice.</p>

<p>Great opportunity for service is afforded the American Protective
League in reporting promptly and accurately all evidence
of enemy propaganda throughout the country. The League is in a
peculiarly advantageous position to secure this information and
present it to the authorities at Washington.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="APPENDIX_C">APPENDIX C<br>
THE ORIGINAL CALL</h3>

<p>The following was the first national summons sent out by
Mr. A. M. Briggs in the early days of the American Protective
League:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have been authorized by the United States Department of
Justice, Bureau of Investigation, to organize confidentially in your
town, a division of the American Protective League. You have
been recommended to me as a man possessing the necessary qualifications
to successfully organize and command the organization,
and I will be glad to have you accept the responsibility of building
the organization in your town and acting as its Chief.</p>

<p>The object of the American Protective League, which is entirely
a patriotic one, no member of which receives any compensation
whatever for his services, is to work under the direction of the
United States Department of Justice, Bureau of Investigation, in
assisting the Department in securing information of the activities
of agents of foreign governments, or persons unfriendly to this
government for the protection of public property, etc., and any
other work that may be assigned to us by the Department at any
time.</p>

<p>Each local organization or Division of the American Protective
League will work under the direction of the Government Agent in
charge of the nearest office of the Department of Justice—and as
Chief of your local Division you will report daily or as often as
necessary, personally or by telephone, telegraph or mail, to your
nearest Special Agent of the Department of Justice.</p>

<p>Your organization should be made up only of American citizens
of high moral character and good standing in your community
who are willing to serve the organization from a purely patriotic
motive and without compensation. Your organization will be in
your charge as Chief and you will properly enroll and swear in
each member of your organization on enrollment blanks which
you will keep on file in your office. As soon as your organization
is complete you will please forward me a duplicate list of your
entire organization, with your name as Chief, with your Captains
and Lieutenants and the men enrolled under each Captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</span></p>

<p>It is essential that the greatest possible secrecy be maintained,
both in forming the organization and in conducting it, and that
all arrangements must be kept as confidential as is practicable,
and, further, that great care must be taken by your entire organization
at all times that nothing is done by it or by any member
of it to unnecessarily alarm aliens in this country or cause them
any apprehension as to the fair manner in which they will be
treated, and that no arrests should be caused excepting after consultation
with the local Government Agent or his assistants.</p>

<p>You will personally administer the oath to each member you
enroll and accept and at the same time assign to that member a
number,—enter his number on his enrollment blank, his commission
card and on the list you will later forward to this office.
Start with Number One, which is your number as Chief.</p>

<p>It is advisable that you consult with the Chief of your local
Police or ask your Government Agent to do so, so that the Chief
of Police may instruct his officers fully in reference to our organization
so that the commission card will be recognized by the
Police in cases where such recognition is desired. You will, undoubtedly,
find that your local Chief of Police will be very glad
to work with your men wherever his assistance may be necessary
in forwarding the interest of the Government.</p>

<p>It is the desire of the Government that every possible source
of information that may be of value to the Department of Justice
be thoroughly and efficiently covered by your organization in your
town and you will please use great care in the selection of the
Captains, Lieutenants and members of each Company so that each
Company can be depended upon to efficiently handle the work
assigned to it.</p>

<p>In forming your organization, bear in mind the great variety of
investigation that you are likely to be called upon by the Government
to make, and make your organization large enough to thoroughly
cover every business, manufacturing and other interests
in your town that in your opinion should be covered—so that you
will be immediately informed of any activity that may prove
directly or indirectly unfriendly to the best interests of the
Government.</p>

<p>You will handle the organization work along the most effective
lines possible. If convenient to do so please confer with your
Government Agent on the entire organization work. It is unnecessary
to call your attention to the fact that the greatest possible
speed consistent with thorough and efficient organization is greatly
desired by the Government.</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 9em;">Yours very truly,</span><br>
<span style="margin-right: 3.5em;">(Signed) A. M. BRIGGS,</span><br>
General Superintendent.
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</span></p>

<p>The selection of Chiefs was inaugurated by the following
communication:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Acting under instructions from Bureau of Investigation, Department
of Justice, we are required to organize a separate branch of
the American Protective League in each town. Our method is to
secure the name of a live, aggressive patriot who is willing to
undertake the responsibility of organizing and acting as Chief of
our branch in his town, and then send him the enclosed letter
which explains the organization work and ask him to undertake
the work. I will be very glad indeed to have you act as the
organizer and Chief of the Branch of the American Protective
League if you can and will do so. Otherwise, I will be very glad
to have you turn the enclosed letter over to the man in your town
whom you select as the best fitted for this responsibility and have
him write me at the above address so that I can authorize him
immediately to go forward with the organization work.</p>

<p>We are sending you under separate cover enrollment blanks
for the enrollment of your organization. You will please personally
fill out one of these blanks and swear to it before a Notary
signing the oath in the presence of the Notary, then forward the
card to this office. After you have taken the oath yourself you
will then proceed to administer it to your men.</p>

<p>Enclosed herewith you will find your commission card as Chief
of your Division, which you will please sign at the same time you
take your oath, and retain. When you fill out your commission
card, please use the date on which you were appointed Chief.</p>

<p>As each member takes the oath, you will issue him a commission
card, filling in his rank either as Captain, Lieutenant or Operative,
and have him sign his card in your presence.</p>

<p>As each man is sworn in, you will please place his number on
the commission card. Please use great care that no commission
card leaves your possession until it is given to a member of your
organization after having been signed by him in your presence at
the time he takes the oath.</p>
</div>

<p>The matter of credentials was at first covered by a letter
of instruction from the Superintendent to all Chiefs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The badges to be worn by the members of the American Protective
League will be ready for shipment within a few days. Your
members are not required to wear a badge if they do not care
to do so. In delivering the badges to your men, please caution
them to wear the badge concealed at all times and not to display
it unless it is necessary to do so while making their investigations.
It is advisable that you consult with the Chief of your local Police<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</span>
or ask the local Government Agent to do so, so that the Chief of
Police may instruct his officers fully in reference to our organization
so that the badge will be recognized by the police in cases
where such recognition is desired. You will, undoubtedly, find
that the local Chief of Police will be very glad to work with your
men wherever their assistance may be necessary in forwarding
the interests of the Government.</p>

<p>It is directed that each member of your organization be sworn
in by you, taking the oath printed on the back of the enclosed
enrollment blank. Paste the oath at the top of a sheet of paper,
and as your men take the oath have them sign on the paper below,
together with the number that you will assign to each man. This
list you will retain in your possession, but as soon as you have
sworn in your entire membership, please send this office a complete
list of your members with their new numbers.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="APPENDIX_D">APPENDIX D<br >
DIGEST OF THE AMENDED ESPIONAGE ACT AS PRINTED
IN “THE SPY GLASS,” JUNE, 1918</h3>

<p>Signed by President Wilson on May 16, the amended
espionage laws opens a new chapter in the work of the
American Protective League. For the first time we have
an inclusive law under which to operate—a law broad
enough in its scope and classifications to cover and define
as serious crimes a multitude of offenses which were classed
as minor by our peace-time code but actually offered
serious hindrances to this country’s military operations and
preparations.</p>

<p>For the first time, too, heavy penalties have been provided
for acts and speeches which before could hardly be punished
at all under the law. Maximum sentences of twenty years
imprisonment and $10,000 fine are not to be taken lightly
either by disloyal and pacifist citizens or by unfriendly or
enemy aliens who have made it their business, since war
was declared, to invent and circulate discreditable stories
about almost every phase of America’s war activities.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">
Disloyalty Now a Crime
</p>

<p>No distinction is made between the disloyal talk or act of a citizen
and the hostile speech or deed of an alien, enemy or otherwise.
The act or speech is the offense and whoever commits it
must pay the penalty—though the law allows a good deal of
latitude to the court in determining the latter.</p>

<p>All this means a tremendous simplification of every member’s
labors. So far-reaching and important are the provisions of the
amended law—so clearly does it indicate the chief kinds of spying
and of propaganda which the League must combat, that the whole
catalogue of crimes may well be set down here for study and
ready reference in months to come. Omitting the preliminary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</span>
enacting clauses and breaking up the main section into handy
paragraphs, the amended law now reads as follows:</p>

<p class="center">
OFFENSES:
</p>

<p><i>I—False and Interfering Reports</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section</span> 3. Whoever, when the United States is at war, shall
willfully make or convey false reports or false statements with
intent to interfere with the operation or success of the military
or naval forces of the United States, or to promote the success
of its enemies,—</p>

<p><i>II—Obstructing Bond Sales, etc.</i></p>

<p>—whoever shall willfully make or convey false reports or false
statements, or say or do anything except by way of bona fide and
not disloyal advice to an investor or investors, with intent to
obstruct the sale by the United States of bonds or other securities
of the United States or the making of loans by or to the United
States,—</p>

<p><i>III—Inciting or Causing Mutiny</i></p>

<p>—whoever, when the United States is at war, shall willfully cause
or attempt to cause or incite or attempt to incite, insubordination,
disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty, in the military or naval
forces of the United States,—</p>

<p><i>IV—Obstructing Enlistments</i></p>

<p>—whoever shall willfully obstruct or attempt to obstruct the
recruiting or enlistment service of the United States,—</p>

<p><i>V—Attacks on Government, Flag, etc.</i></p>

<p>—whoever, when the United States is at war, shall willfully utter,
print, write, or publish any disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive
language about the form of government of the United States, or
the Constitution of the United States, or the military or naval
forces of the United States, or the flag of the United States, or
the uniform of the Army or Navy of the United States, or any
language intended to bring the form of government of the United
States, or the Constitution of the United States, or the military
or naval forces of the United States, or the flag of the United
States, or the uniform of the Army or Navy of the United States
into contempt, scorn, contumely, or disrepute,—</p>

<p><i>VI—Encouraging Resistance</i></p>

<p>—whoever shall willfully utter, print, write, or publish any language<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</span>
intended to incite, provoke, or encourage resistance to the
United States, or to promote the cause of its enemies, or shall
willfully display the flag of any enemy,—</p>

<p><i>VII—Curtailing Production</i></p>

<p>—whoever shall willfully by utterance, writing, printing, publication,
or language spoken, urge, incite, or advocate any curtailment
of production in this country of anything or things, product or
products, necessary or essential to the prosecution of the war in
which the United States may be engaged, with intent by such
curtailment to cripple or hinder the United States in the prosecution
of the war,—</p>

<p><i>VIII—Defending or Teaching Disloyalty</i></p>

<p>—whoever shall willfully advocate, teach, defend, or suggest the
doing of any of the acts or things in this section enumerated,—</p>

<p><i>IX—Supporting the Enemy</i></p>

<p>—<b>and whoever shall by word or act support or favor the cause of
any country with which the United States is at war, or by word or
act oppose the cause of the United States therein</b>,—</p>

<p>THE PENALTY:</p>

<p>—<b>shall be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment
for not more than twenty years, or both.</b></p>

<p>An additional section of the amended law provides for the
instant dismissal of any official or employee of the United States
who commits a disloyal act or utters disloyal or unpatriotic language.
This is as follows:</p>

<p>Any employee or official of the United States Government who
commits any disloyal act or utters any unpatriotic or disloyal
language, or who, in an abusive and violent manner criticizes the
Army or Navy or the flag of the United States shall be at once
dismissed from the service. Any such employee shall be dismissed
by the head of the department in which the employee may be
engaged, and any such official shall be dismissed by the authority
having power to appoint a successor to the dismissed official.</p>

<p class="center">
No Mail For Propagandists
</p>

<p>Plotting or propaganda by mail is made punishable by immediate
withdrawal of postal privileges from any individual or firm,
against whom satisfactory evidence is brought that he is violating
any provision of this new law. Conviction is not necessary:
evidence satisfactory to the Postmaster General is enough to close
the mails to the offender. Here is the amended section:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 4. When the United States is at war, the Postmaster
General may, upon evidence satisfactory to him that any person
or concern is using the mails in violation of any of the provisions
of this Act, instruct the postmaster at any post office at which
mail is received addressed to such person or concern to return
to the postmaster at the office at which they were originally
mailed all letters or other matter so addressed, with the words
“Mail to this address undeliverable under Espionage Act” plainly
written or stamped upon the outside thereof and all such letters
or other matter so returned to such postmasters shall be by them
returned to the senders thereof under such regulations as the
Postmaster General may prescribe.</p>

<p class="center">
An All-Embracing Clause
</p>

<p>Read over the ninth clause of section 3 again: “whoever shall
by word or act support or favor the cause of any country with
which the United States is at war, or by word or act oppose the
cause of the United States therein—.” That clause alone serves
to make enemy propaganda or native-born sedition a hazardous
undertaking in any community where League members are awake
and on the job.</p>

<p>Gone is the necessity of arguing and pleading with the pro-German,
the pacifist and the native-born disloyalist to speak with
straight tongues. Loyal citizens retain the right to free speech and
to honest and reasonable criticism of the Government’s actions
and policies. But indiscriminate abuse and lying reports of what
is happening here at home or overseas are going to stop. The
amended law is a powerful weapon put into our hands for that
very purpose.</p>

<p>Notice also that the word “willfully” is omitted in Clause Nine.
To convict a man of disloyalty or sedition, you will not have to
prove his disloyal or hostile intention. Like murder or burglary,
espionage and sedition are become positive crimes. No one who
commits them can plead innocent intent.</p>

REMOVAL OF ALIEN ENEMIES</h3>

<p>R. S. SEC. 4067 (as amended). Whenever there is a declared
war between the United States and any foreign nation or government,

PRESIDENTIAL PROCLAMATION REGARDING REGULATION
OF ALIEN ENEMIES</h3>

<p>Pursuant to the authority vested in me, I hereby declare and
establish the following regulations, which I find necessary in the
premises and for the public safety:</p>

<p>(1) An alien enemy shall <i>not have in his possession</i> at any
time or place any fire-arm, <i>weapon</i> or implement of war, or
component part thereof, <i>ammunition</i>, maxim, or other silencer,
bomb, or explosive or material used in the manufacture of explosives;</p>

<p>(2) An alien enemy shall not have in his possession at any
time or place, or use or operate any aircraft or <i>wireless apparatus</i>,
or any form of signalling device, or any form of <i>cipher code</i>, or
any paper, document or book written or printed in cipher or in
which there may be invisible writing.</p>

<p>(3) All property found in the possession of an alien enemy
in violation of the foregoing regulations shall be subject to
<i>seizure</i> by the United States;</p>

<p>(4) An alien enemy shall <i>not approach or be found within one-half
of a mile of any Federal or State fort</i>, camp, arsenal, aircraft
station, Government or naval vessel, navy yard, <i>factory</i>, or workshop
for the manufacture of munitions of war or of any products
for the use of the army or navy;</p>

<p>(5) An alien enemy shall <i>not write, print, or publish any attack
